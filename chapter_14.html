                    We are saved, preserved, perfected, and sanctified by that which we choose to obey. God does not, will not, cannot, force his laws upon us. Rather, he teaches us, through the light of Christ in its varying intensities, the consequences of obedience and disobedience to the varieties of law in the universe. We then choose what we are willing to obey and, consequently, what we are willing to be blessed by. Obedience to law enlarges, enables, and empowers us. We are not restricted or limited by law, but are set free and propelled forward by our obedience to it. The greater our obedience, the greater our safety, perfection, sanctification, and glory. . . Obedience enables; disobedience disables. There is no other way. </p>

                    The function of the Lord’s gospel principles, laws of the spirit with their attendant instructions, covenants and commandments are exact laws of light explicitly designed by the Creator to increase our individual sensitivity to receive and capacity to absorb light and energy radiating around us, in us and through us from the dimension of spirit. These rays [light and energy] are the paramount factor in the enrichment and magnification fo the life force within us. They are the source of spiritual revitalization and sustenance—quite literally the food of our spirit! . . .

                    <br><br>

                    The commandments of God are not silly rules laid down by illusionary men of ignorance. They are firmly established laws of light! . . . . These rules of refined radiation (commandments) are as critically essential to healthy, wholesome life as is nourishment derived from nutritionally well-balanced meals. . . . In the dimension of spirit, life and death quite factually exist by degree of lesser or greater concentrations of intensities of light and energy—a continuum of degree between light, vitality and life on one hand and darkness, lethargy and death on the other. . .
                    <br><br>


                    The human spirit is an entity of energy, form and substance in its own right, quite distinctly separate from the physical. It is a magnificent instrument of superior sensitivity, capability and capacity possessing vast power to receive, process, analyze, synthesize, absorb and generate light and energy far exceeding our conscious awareness. It is critically imperative to a fully healthy, happy, vital life to do so! </p>

                    When obedience becomes our goal, it is no longer an irritation; instead of a stumbling block, it becomes a building block. . . . Obedience brings peace in decision making.

                    Applying fixed principles will result in temptations either being deliberately avoided in the first place or in being quickly deflected. All of this can be achieved without great thought, risk, or needless anxiety. . . . If we are truly attached to immortal principles, some decisions need to be made only once and then righteous reflexes can do the rest. Absent such fixed determinations, however, one can be tossed to and fro by temptations that then require case-by-case agonizing. </p>

                    There is nothing good unless you do it. You and I may speak most eloquently of spiritual things. We may impress people with our keen intellectual interpretation of religious topics. We may rhapsodize about religion and “dream of our mansion above.” But if our faith does not change the way we live—if our beliefs do not influence our daily decisions—our religion is vain, and our faith, if not dead, is certainly not well and is in danger of eventually flatlining. Obedience is the lifeblood of faith. It is by obedience that we gather light into our souls. </p>

                    Pause for a moment and check where your own heart and thoughts are. Are you focused on the things that matter most? How you spend your quiet time may provide a valuable clue. Where do your thoughts go when the pressure of deadlines is gone? Are your thoughts and heart focused on those short-lived fleeting things that matter only in the moment or on things that matter most?

                    Sometimes the things that distract us are not bad in and of themselves; often they even make us feel good. It is possible to take even good things to excess. Even some programs of the Church can become a distraction if we take them to extremes and allow them to dominate our time and our attention at the expense of things that matter most. We need balance in life. </p>

                    Mortal choices need not necessarily be wicked in order to do harm. Some choices are diversions more than they are transgressions. As a result of these diversions, the sins of omission mount up. . . .Striking the proper balance is one of the keenest tests of our agency. Therefore, we need to ask regularly for inspiration in the use of our time and in the making of our daily decisions. So often our hardest choices are between competing and desirable alternatives (each with righteous consequences), when there is not time to do both at once. Indeed, it is at these mortal intersections—where time and talent and opportunities meet—that priorities, like traffic lights, are sorely needed. Quiet, sustained goodness is the order of heaven, not conspicuous, but episodic busyness. </p>

                    We should begin by recognizing the reality that just because something is good is not sufficient reason for doing it. The number of good things we can do far exceeds the time available to accomplish them. Some things are better than good, and these are the things that should command priority attention in our lives. . . .


                    <br><br>
                    As we consider various choices, we should remember that it is not enough that something is good. Other choices are better, and still others are best. . . . Consider how we use our time in the choices we make in viewing television, playing video games, surfing the Internet, or reading books or magazines. Of course it is good to view wholesome entertainment or to obtain interesting information. But not everything of that sort is worth the portion of our life we give to obtain it. Some things are better, and others are best. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Some uses of individual and family time are better, and others are best. We have to forego some good things in order to choose others that are better or best because they develop faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthen our families.

                    One of the signs of our spiritual maturity is steadiness, our capacity to navigate the strait and narrow path in a stable and fairly consistent manner, to work with zeal but patient maturity, to stay in the mainstream of the Church. God does not expect us to work ourselves into spiritual, emotional, or physical oblivion, nor does he desire that the members of the true church be truer than true. There is little virtue in excess, even in gospel excess. In fact, as members of the Church exceed the bounds of propriety and go beyond the established mark, they open themselves to deception and ultimately to destruction. Imbalance leads to instability. If Satan cannot cause us to lie or steal or smoke or be immoral, it just may be that he will cause our strength —our zeal for goodness and righteousness—to become our weakness. He will encourage excess, for surely virtue, when taken to the extreme, becomes a vice. </p>

                    As we look at the misbehavior we see in each of us, we see both aberrations and preoccupations. Preoccupations can be a sign that some things have come to mean too much to us. Though not necessarily bad in itself, a preoccupation can exercise dominion over us. But whether obsessions, rationalizations, or preoccupations, each is a diversion. Messes of pottage respond to the “now” in us, where as only the submissive heart and mind see eternity’s considerations. </p>

                    To push ourselves beyond the mark is, in a strange sort of way, a statement that we fear we must do the job ourselves if we expect it to get done. Of course we must do our duty in the Church and other works of righteousness that are necessary. What seems so unnecessary is the pharisaical extremism and exhausting frustration that too often characterize the efforts of some members of the Church. God is unquestionably aware of us. He loves you, and he loves me. This I know. He certainly wants us to improve, but he definitely does not want us to spend our days languishing in guilt. The gospel of Jesus Christ is intended to liberate us, to lift and lighten our burdens. If it is not doing that in our lives, then perhaps our approach and understanding—not necessarily the quantity of work to be done—may need some adjustment.

                    Satan realizes he cannot always use his “heavy arsenal of temptations” to be immoral or dishonest or violent on good, conscientious people. These “fiery darts” would probably have little, if any, immediate effect on faithful people who are diligently striving to be righteous. He knows he will be far more successful if he can get us frustrated—“harassed” and “perplexed” —by our inability to do all the good things we would like to do (or sometimes feel we “have” to do).

                    We can undertake a Benjamin Franklin approach to repentance by working on a vice (or a virtue) for a season and then move on to the next one. But, to be honest, most of us don’t have that much time in this life. Or energy.

                    The same is true of performing our assignments and doing everything else that is expected of us. We can grit our teeth, tighten our grip on the iron rod until our knuckles go white, and hold on for dear life. We can do our jobs with tenacity and willpower and discipline. To be sure, a certain amount of discipline is associated with discipleship; the Lord expects us to give him our best shot. But he does not expect us to do all of this by ourselves. He has offered to help us, to strengthen us, to enable us and empower us. That’s a pretty generous offer, and we would be foolish to refuse or ignore it. </p>

                    The problem with preferring the external over the internal is that though the obedience to external religious acts can look pious and spiritual, the acts can arise, not out of a pure heart of love for God and others, but out of pride and self-centeredness and a desire to prove to oneself or others one’s spirituality. Thus, external acts do not necessarily indicate or even produce spiritual development. Therefore, for those aspiring to a higher stage, these acts are not spiritually adequate in themselves. </p>

Strangely enough, the key to freedom is obedience.

                    No principle pertaining to the Gospel is of greater importance than obedience, for without obedience no blessing can come upon the people. Men my talk all their lives about their faith; but, if they do not obey, they can not obtain the promised blessings. For instance, a man may say that he believes in Jesus and that He is the Son of God; he may believe in baptism and the laying on of hands; but can he get his sins remitted or receive the Holy Ghost if he should not obey baptism or the laying on of hands? </p>

                    From an initial experiment thought to be trivial, a vicious cycle may follow. From trial comes a habit. From habit comes dependence. From dependence comes addiction. Its grasp is so gradual. Enslaving shackles of habit are too small to be sensed until they are too strong to be broken. . . . Addiction surrenders later freedom to choose.

                    There are two influences in the world today, and have been from the beginning. One is an influence that is constructive, that radiates happiness and builds character. The other influence is one that destroys, turns men into demons, tears down and discourages. We are all susceptible to both. The one comes from our Heavenly Father, and the other comes from the source of evil that has been in the world from the beginning, seeking to bring about the destruction of the human family. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    My grandfather used to say to his family, “There is a line of demarcation, well defined, between the Lord’s territory and the devil’s. If you will stay on the Lord’s side of the line you will be under his influence and will have no desire to do wrong; but if you cross to the devil’s side of the line one inch, you are in the tempter’s power, and if he is successful, you will not be able to think or even reason properly, because you will have lost the Spirit of the Lord.

                    <br><br>

                    When I have been tempted sometimes to do a certain thing, I have asked myself, “Which side of the line am I on?” If I determined to be on the safe side, the Lord’s side, I would do the right thing every time. So when temptation comes, think prayerfully about your problem, and the influence of the Spirit of the Lord will enable you to decide wisely. There is safety for us only on the Lord’s side of the line.

                    <br><br>

                    If you want to be happy, remember, that all happiness worthy of the name is on the Lord’s side of the line and all sorrow and disappointment is on the devil’s side of the line. </p>

                    There appear to be immutable laws in the universe that offer both a choice and a consequence, and hence, in this sense, they are spiritual laws. These spiritual laws govern all intelligent beings in the universe—and also govern their progress. For these purposes, progress means an increase in eternal power. In other words, there seem to exist certain immutable laws that will bring power if they are followed or “obeyed,” but if they are neglected or “disobeyed” they may trigger the opposite result. </p>

                    Some might contend that freedom comes when there are no laws or restraints. They contend that freedom in its purest form is the right to do anything, anytime, anywhere, without consequence. Does it not seem ironic that such a philosophy is authored by the master slave himself? It was he who was cast out of heaven, who was deprived of a body, who will be bound a thousand years, and who will ultimately be banished to outer darkness. The freedom he promises is illusory; it is a mirage in the desert; it is the very condition that has always eluded his grasp. </p>

                    We are too inclined to think of law as something merely restrictive . . . something hemming us in. We sometimes think of law as the opposite of liberty. But that is a false conception. . . . God does not contradict himself. He did not create man and then, as an afterthought, impose upon him a set of arbitrary, irritating, restrictive rules. He made man free—and then gave him the commandments to keep him free. We cannot break the Ten Commandments. We can only break ourselves against them—or else, by keeping them, rise through them to the fullness of freedom under God. </p>

Such is the "sacrifice unto the Lord . . . of a broken heart and a contrite spirit," a prerequisite to taking up the cross, while giving "away all [our] sins" in order to "know God;" for the denial of self precedes the full acceptance of Him. </p>

He is not trying to see how much He can squeeze out of us, but rather how much He can squeeze into us. . . . The Lord is much more concerned with the offerer than He is with the offering. </p>

                    Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation; for, from the first existence of man, the faith necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained without the sacrifice of all earthly things. It was through this sacrifice, and this only, that God has ordained that men should enjoy eternal life; and it is though the medium of the sacrifice of all earthly things that men do actually know that they are doing the things that are well pleasing in the sight of God. When a man has offered in sacrifice all that he has for the truth’s sake, not even withholding his life, and believing before God that he has been called to make this sacrifice because he seeks to do his will, he does know; most assuredly, that God does and will accept his sacrifice and offering, and that he has not, nor will not seek his face in vain. Under these circumstances, then, he can obtain the faith necessary for him to lay hold on eternal life.

                    Inasmuch as our will is the only thing that we can, in the long run, really consecrate to God, the Lord needs to know of our willingness to be broken by him. That is, to what degree are we willing to submit, to surrender, to yield our hearts unto him? What happens in the breaking of a horse? Contrary to what many people believe, the horse’s spirit isn’t broken. A well-broken horse remains strong, eager, quick-witted, and aware, and he love to gallop when given free rein. Rather, it is the horse’s independence that is broken. The breaking of a horse results in the horse giving instant obedience to its rider.

                    When a child of God is broken, God does not destroy his or her spirit. We don’t lose our zest for living when we come to Christ. We don’t lose the force of our personality. Rather, we lose our independence. Our will is brought into submission to the will of the Father so that we can give instant obedience to the one whom we call Savior and Lord. . . </p>

                    For those who have already strayed from the “strait and narrow” and lost blessings and opportunities they might have had, it is not too late. Do not focus on what you have lost; focus on what you may still accomplish. Sometimes repentant sinners work so diligently and steadily to make up lost ground that they may actually surpass those Saints who have never wandered far from the path but who have never “lengthened their stride” either. </p>

                    There is no one great thing that man can do and then do no more and obtain salvation. After entering into the kingdom of God, . . . it is by learning “precept upon precept; line upon line; here a little and there a little,” that salvation will be made secure. It is by resisting temptation today, overcoming a weakness tomorrow, forsaking evil associations the next day, and thus day by day, month after month, year after year, pruning, restraining and weeding out that which is evil in the disposition, that the character is purged of its imperfections. Salvation is a matter of character-building under the Gospel laws and ordinances, and more especially with the direct aid of the Holy Spirit.


                    <br><br>
                    Nor is it enough that one get rid of evil. He must do good. He must surround himself with circumstances congenial to the sensitive nature of the Holy Ghost, that he may not be offended, and withdraw himself; for if he does so, amen to the man’s spiritual or moral development. He must cultivate noble sentiments by performing noble deeds—not great ones, necessarily, for opportunity to do what the world esteems great things, comes but seldom to men in the ordinary walks of life; but noble deeds may be done every day; and every such deed performed with an eye single to the glory of God, draws one that much nearer into harmony with Deity. </p>

                    We must put God in the forefront of everything else in our lives. He must come first, just as He declares in the first of His Ten Commandments: ‘Thou shalt have no other gods before me.’ (Exodus 20:3). When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives. Our love of the Lord will govern the claims for our affection, the demands on our time, the interests we pursue, and the order of our priorities. We should put God ahead of everyone else in our lives. </p>

                    In modern revelation we are told very frankly that “when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.” I don’t know how it is for you, but I have felt so often in my life so greatly blessed for what little obedience I have given. My conclusion with regard to that verse is that the Lord’s ration of blessings to our obedience is a very generous ration indeed. He is so quick to reward us, so quick to reassure us, and so anxious to take delight when we serve Him. So if you puzzle over that verse, as I have in life, the only bottom line I can give you is that the ration of blessings to our minuscule obedience is a very, very generous ratio indeed. </p>

                    The submission of one's will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God's altar. It is a hard doctrine, but it is true. The many other things we give to God, however nice that may be of us, are actually things He has already given us, and He has loaned them to us. But when we begin to submit ourselves by letting our wills be swallowed up in God's will, then we are really giving something to Him. And that hard doctrine lies at the center of discipleship. There is a part of us that is ultimately sovereign, the mind and heart, where we really do decide which way to go and what to do. And when we submit to His will, then we've really given Him the one thing He asks of us. And the other things are not very, very important. It is the only possession we have that we can give, and there is no resulting shortage in our agency as a result. Instead, what we see is a flowering of our talents and more and more surges of joy. Submission to Him is the only form of submission that is completely safe. </p>

                    One’s individual will thus remains uniquely his. God will not override it nor overwhelm it. Hence we’d better want the consequences of what we want!

                    <br><br>
                    Another cosmic fact: only by aligning our wills with God’s is full happiness to be found. Anything less results in a lesser portion.
                    <br><br>


                    Progression toward submission confers another blessing: an enhanced capacity for joy. If you want to enjoy exquisitely, become a Latter-day Saint, and then live the doctrine of Jesus Christ.

                    Desire denotes a real longing or craving. Hence righteous desires are much more than passive preferences or fleeting feelings.


                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, what we insistently desire, over time, is what we will eventually become and what we will receive in eternity.
                    <br><br>


                    Like it or not, therefore, reality requires that we acknowledge our responsibility for our desires. Brothers and sisters, which do we really desire, God’s plans for us or Satan’s?
                    <br><br>


                    It is up to us. God will facilitate, but He will not force. </p>

                    Do you think that people will obey the truth because it is true, unless they love it? No, they will not. Thus knowing gospel truths and doctrines is profoundly important, but we must also come to love them. When we love them, they will move us and help our desires and outward works to become more holy. </p>

                    Consecration is not shoulder-shrugging acceptance, but, instead, shoulder-squaring to better bear the yoke. . . It would change the entire Church if in every ward, we could have just three or four more families who became truly consecrated disciples of Jesus Christ instead of just being active in the Church. </p>
