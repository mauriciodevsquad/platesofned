    We are saved, preserved, perfected, and sanctified by that which we choose to obey. God does not, will not, cannot, force his laws upon us. Rather, he teaches us, through the light of Christ in its varying intensities, the consequences of obedience and disobedience to the varieties of law in the universe. We then choose what we are willing to obey and, consequently, what we are willing to be blessed by. Obedience to law enlarges, enables, and empowers us. We are not restricted or limited by law, but are set free and propelled forward by our obedience to it. The greater our obedience, the greater our safety, perfection, sanctification, and glory. . . Obedience enables; disobedience disables. There is no other way. Robinson & Garrett, A Commentary on the Doctrine and Covenants, 3:108-109.


    2
    The function of the Lord’s gospel principles, laws of the spirit with their attendant instructions, covenants and commandments are exact laws of light explicitly designed by the Creator to increase our individual sensitivity to receive and capacity to absorb light and energy radiating around us, in us and through us from the dimension of spirit. These rays [light and energy] are the paramount factor in the enrichment and magnification fo the life force within us. They are the source of spiritual revitalization and sustenance—quite literally the food of our spirit! . . .



    The commandments of God are not silly rules laid down by illusionary men of ignorance. They are firmly established laws of light! . . . . These rules of refined radiation (commandments) are as critically essential to healthy, wholesome life as is nourishment derived from nutritionally well-balanced meals. . . . In the dimension of spirit, life and death quite factually exist by degree of lesser or greater concentrations of intensities of light and energy—a continuum of degree between light, vitality and life on one hand and darkness, lethargy and death on the other. . .



    The human spirit is an entity of energy, form and substance in its own right, quite distinctly separate from the physical. It is a magnificent instrument of superior sensitivity, capability and capacity possessing vast power to receive, process, analyze, synthesize, absorb and generate light and energy far exceeding our conscious awareness. It is critically imperative to a fully healthy, happy, vital life to do so! William M. Stelter, Particles & Waves, 39-41, 43.


    3
    We are looked upon by God, who dwells in eternity, as though we were in eternity, and when His commandments touch us it is in view of eternity. He does not view things as we do. Joseph Smith, "The King Follett Discourse," BYU Studies, 18:2:204.


    4
    God is God not just because He is the law giver but because He is the law obeyer. Brad Wilcox, The Continuous Atonement, 125.


    5
    I made this my rule: When God commands, do it! Joseph Smith, History of the Church, 2:170.


    6
    I teach the people correct principles, and they govern themselves. Joseph Smith; John Taylor, J.D., 10:57-58.


    7
    My religion is to know the will of God and do it. Brigham Young, J.D., 14:118.


    8
    No obstacles are insurmountable when God commands and we obey.

    Heber J. Grant, Teachings of Presidents of the Church, x.


    9
    May we maintain the courage to defy the consensus. May we ever choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong. Thomas S. Monson, “Choices,” Ensign, May 2016, 86.


    10
    We begin to keep the commandments today, and we keep more of them tomorrow, and we go from grace to grace, up the steps of the ladder. Bruce R. McConkie, "Jesus Christ and Him Crucified," BYU Fireside, September 1976.


    11
    When obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, then God will endow us with power from on high.

    Ezra Taft Benson, “To the Single Adult Brethren of the Church,” Ensign, May 1988, 81.


    12
    When obedience becomes our goal, it is no longer an irritation; instead of a stumbling block, it becomes a building block. . . . Obedience brings peace in decision making. If we have firmly made up our minds to follow the commandments, we will not have to redecide which path to take when temptation comes our way. That is how obedience brings spiritual safety. James E. Faust, "Obedience: The Path to Freedom," Ensign, May 1999, 47.


    13
    When we know . . . and when we do what we know . . . then we become what God invites us to become. Dallin H. Oaks, Life's Lessons learned, 158.


    14
    That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that our power to do it is increased. Heber J. Grant, CR, Apr. 1901, 63.


    15
    In obedience there is joy and peace unspotted. Joseph Smith, History of the Church, 5:135.


    16
    There is a superior intelligence bestowed upon such as obey the gospel with full purpose of heart.

    Joseph Smith, Teachings of Presidents of the Church, 321.


    17
    Obedience is the key to spiritual growth. Receiving more light is possible, but growing in spiritual light is not a function of intellectual effort alone. It is a function of our willingness to follow and act on the light we already have. C. Robert Line, Endowed with Power, 109.


    18
    If you become one who just knows the truths rather than one who seeks to apply them, you will not teach by the spirit and you will not change people's lives, including your own. The Lord gives us truth on the basis of how fast we apply them. If you'll put them into your life---changing self, repenting---the Lord will continue to give you more and more. Gene R. Cook, (to Religious Education Department, BYU, Park City, Utah, September 1, 1989).


    19
    Applying fixed principles will result in temptations either being deliberately avoided in the first place or in being quickly deflected. All of this can be achieved without great thought, risk, or needless anxiety. . . . If we are truly attached to immortal principles, some decisions need to be made only once and then righteous reflexes can do the rest. Absent such fixed determinations, however, one can be tossed to and fro by temptations that then require case-by-case agonizing. Neal A. Maxwell, "The Pathway of Discipleship," BYU Fireside, January 4, 1998.


    20
    While free agency is deliciously wonderful, we need be aware there are rewards both pleasant and painful lurking behind our choices. . . . Obedience brings benevolent blessings while violation inherently results in pain and sorrow—from the very same law! . . . We can only “harvest” that which we have “sown.” William Melton Stetler, Particles and Waves, 236- 237, 239.


    21
    God is bound when we do what He says, but when we don't, God is equally bound---not to bless, but to allow us that freedom to choose. Brad Wilcox, The Continuous Atonement, 127.


    22
    Obedience invites the witness of the Spirit. Alongside the blessings we receive from submitting to God’s commandments is a continuous confirming of truth. David B. Marsh, Doubt Not, But Be Believing, 91.


    23
    The supreme act of worship is to keep the commandments. Joseph Fielding Smith, “I Know That My Redeemer Liveth,” Ensign, December 1971, 127.


    24
    Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it, and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God. TPJS, 255. 


    25
    The degree to which we fully embrace Christ’s teachings and commands is the degree to which we will find the gospel a blessing and strength in our lives. Alonzo L. Gaskill, Converted, 3.


    26
    The Lord cannot save us without our own good-faith effort . . . no matter how much He would give to make us His. . . . He not only would not, He cannot control us against our will. Bruce C. Hafen, The Believing Heart, 85.


    27
    The most important of all commandments of God is that one that you are having the most difficulty keeping today. The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, 82. 


    28
    Every man must light his own lamp with the oil of righteousness which he buys at the market of obedience.

    Bruce R. McConkie, The Mortal Messiah, 3:468.


    29
    If you have not chosen the Kingdom of God, it will make in the end no difference what you have chosen instead. William Law (1686-1761), quoted in Neal A. Maxwell, The Smallest Part, 1.


    30
    One major cause of real fatigue, little appreciated by those so afflicted, is trying to serve two masters. This is devastating double duty. Neal A. Maxwell, If Thou Endure It Well, 114.


    31
    Every time we make a choice we are being changed—a lifetime of choices turns us into a heavenly or hellish creature, in harmony with God or hating God, at peace or at war. C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity, 92.


    32
    When we act out of harmony with God’s commandments, it’s not so much that we have broken the arbitrary rules of a stern taskmaster but that we have departed from our own true nature and destiny and are in need of a course correction. Patrick Q. Mason, Planted, Belief and Belonging in an Age of Doubt, 92.


    33
    There is nothing good unless you do it. You and I may speak most eloquently of spiritual things. We may impress people with our keen intellectual interpretation of religious topics. We may rhapsodize about religion and “dream of our mansion above.” But if our faith does not change the way we live—if our beliefs do not influence our daily decisions—our religion is vain, and our faith, if not dead, is certainly not well and is in danger of eventually flatlining. Obedience is the lifeblood of faith. It is by obedience that we gather light into our souls. Dieter f. Uchtdorf, “He Will Place You on His Shoulders and Carry You Home,” Ensign, May 2016, 103.


    34
    Pause for a moment and check where your own heart and thoughts are. Are you focused on the things that matter most? How you spend your quiet time may provide a valuable clue. Where do your thoughts go when the pressure of deadlines is gone? Are your thoughts and heart focused on those short-lived fleeting things that matter only in the moment or on things that matter most?



    Sometimes the things that distract us are not bad in and of themselves; often they even make us feel good. It is possible to take even good things to excess. Even some programs of the Church can become a distraction if we take them to extremes and allow them to dominate our time and our attention at the expense of things that matter most. We need balance in life. Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “We are Doing a Great Work and Cannot Come Down,” Ensign, May 2009, 60.


    35
    Mortal choices need not necessarily be wicked in order to do harm. Some choices are diversions more than they are transgressions. As a result of these diversions, the sins of omission mount up. . . .Striking the proper balance is one of the keenest tests of our agency. Therefore, we need to ask regularly for inspiration in the use of our time and in the making of our daily decisions. So often our hardest choices are between competing and desirable alternatives (each with righteous consequences), when there is not time to do both at once. Indeed, it is at these mortal intersections—where time and talent and opportunities meet—that priorities, like traffic lights, are sorely needed. Quiet, sustained goodness is the order of heaven, not conspicuous, but episodic busyness. Neal A. Maxwell, “Sharing Insights from My Life,” BYU Devotional, January 1999.


    36
    We should begin by recognizing the reality that just because something is good is not sufficient reason for doing it. The number of good things we can do far exceeds the time available to accomplish them. Some things are better than good, and these are the things that should command priority attention in our lives. . . .



    As we consider various choices, we should remember that it is not enough that something is good. Other choices are better, and still others are best. . . . Consider how we use our time in the choices we make in viewing television, playing video games, surfing the Internet, or reading books or magazines. Of course it is good to view wholesome entertainment or to obtain interesting information. But not everything of that sort is worth the portion of our life we give to obtain it. Some things are better, and others are best. . . .



    Some uses of individual and family time are better, and others are best. We have to forego some good things in order to choose others that are better or best because they develop faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthen our families.

    Dallin H. Oaks, “Good, Better, Best,” Ensign, Nov. 2007, 104-105. 


    37
    One of the signs of our spiritual maturity is steadiness, our capacity to navigate the strait and narrow path in a stable and fairly consistent manner, to work with zeal but patient maturity, to stay in the mainstream of the Church. God does not expect us to work ourselves into spiritual, emotional, or physical oblivion, nor does he desire that the members of the true church be truer than true. There is little virtue in excess, even in gospel excess. In fact, as members of the Church exceed the bounds of propriety and go beyond the established mark, they open themselves to deception and ultimately to destruction. Imbalance leads to instability. If Satan cannot cause us to lie or steal or smoke or be immoral, it just may be that he will cause our strength —our zeal for goodness and righteousness—to become our weakness. He will encourage excess, for surely virtue, when taken to the extreme, becomes a vice. Selected Writings of Robert L. Millet, 372.


    38
    As we look at the misbehavior we see in each of us, we see both aberrations and preoccupations. Preoccupations can be a sign that some things have come to mean too much to us. Though not necessarily bad in itself, a preoccupation can exercise dominion over us. But whether obsessions, rationalizations, or preoccupations, each is a diversion. Messes of pottage respond to the “now” in us, where as only the submissive heart and mind see eternity’s considerations. Neal A. Maxwell, Not my will, but Thine, 60.


    39
    We frequently look about us and see people who incline to extremes, who are fanatical. We may be sure that this class of people do not understand the gospel. They have forgotten, if they ever knew, that it is very unwise to take a fragment of truth and treat it as if it were the whole thing. Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine, 122.


    40
    If Satan can’t get us to abandon the principles of the gospel, he is content that we should live them obsessively or as fanatics. One is less than the will of the Lord; the other is more. Either puts us in the territory of the wicked one . . . Satan loves a fanatic as much as a rebel, for they are both off the path and therefore in his power. Stephen Robinson, Following Christ, 111.


    41
    To push ourselves beyond the mark is, in a strange sort of way, a statement that we fear we must do the job ourselves if we expect it to get done. Of course we must do our duty in the Church and other works of righteousness that are necessary. What seems so unnecessary is the pharisaical extremism and exhausting frustration that too often characterize the efforts of some members of the Church. God is unquestionably aware of us. He loves you, and he loves me. This I know. He certainly wants us to improve, but he definitely does not want us to spend our days languishing in guilt. The gospel of Jesus Christ is intended to liberate us, to lift and lighten our burdens. If it is not doing that in our lives, then perhaps our approach and understanding—not necessarily the quantity of work to be done—may need some adjustment. 

    Robert L. Millet, Grace Works, 132-133.


    42
    Satan realizes he cannot always use his “heavy arsenal of temptations” to be immoral or dishonest or violent on good, conscientious people. These “fiery darts” would probably have little, if any, immediate effect on faithful people who are diligently striving to be righteous. He knows he will be far more successful if he can get us frustrated—“harassed” and “perplexed” —by our inability to do all the good things we would like to do (or sometimes feel we “have” to do).

    Brent L. Top, “Choosing the Good Part,” Religious Educator, Vol 2:1, 50.


    43
    We can undertake a Benjamin Franklin approach to repentance by working on a vice (or a virtue) for a season and then move on to the next one. But, to be honest, most of us don’t have that much time in this life. Or energy.



    The same is true of performing our assignments and doing everything else that is expected of us. We can grit our teeth, tighten our grip on the iron rod until our knuckles go white, and hold on for dear life. We can do our jobs with tenacity and willpower and discipline. To be sure, a certain amount of discipline is associated with discipleship; the Lord expects us to give him our best shot. But he does not expect us to do all of this by ourselves. He has offered to help us, to strengthen us, to enable us and empower us. That’s a pretty generous offer, and we would be foolish to refuse or ignore it. Robert L. Millet, Grace Works, 92. 


    44
    The problem with preferring the external over the internal is that though the obedience to external religious acts can look pious and spiritual, the acts can arise, not out of a pure heart of love for God and others, but out of pride and self-centeredness and a desire to prove to oneself or others one’s spirituality. Thus, external acts do not necessarily indicate or even produce spiritual development. Therefore, for those aspiring to a higher stage, these acts are not spiritually adequate in themselves. Thomas Keating, Intimacy with God, 3.


    45
    Handing everything over to Christ does not of course, mean that you stop trying. To trust Him means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity, 130-131.


    46
    Obedience—that which God will never take by force—He will accept when freely given. And he will then return to you freedom that you can hardly dream of—the freedom to feel and to know, the freedom to do, and the freedom to be, at least a thousandfold more than we offer Him. Strangely enough, the key to freedom is obedience.

    Boyd K. Packer, That All May Be Edified, 256.


    47
    What comes first, Church or family? . . . Well, doesn’t the kingdom lead out? No, isn’t the family the most important unit in time and eternity? The fact is God comes first, and if we seek his will, he will make known to us what, in that specific instance, comes second. Robert L. Millet, Men of Valor, 44.


    48
    Whatever God commands is right, no matter what it is, although we may not see the reason thereof till long after the events transpire. . . . But in obedience there is joy and peace unspotted, unalloyed; and as God has designed our happiness--- and the happiness of all His creatures, He never has---He never will institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people that is not calculated to its nature to promote that happiness which He has designed, and which will not end in the greatest amount of good and glory to those who become the recipients of his law and ordinances. TPJS, 256-257.


    49
    Those who talk of obedience may appear to know many things, but they do not understand the doctrines of the gospel. There is obedience that comes from a knowledge of the truth that transcends any external form of control. We are not obedient because we are blind, we are obedient because we can see. Boyd K. Packer, “Agency and Control,” Ensign, May 1983, 66.


    50
    There is but one path of safety for the Latter-day Saints, and that is the path of duty. It is not a testimony only; it is not marvelous manifestations; it is not knowing that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true, that it is the plan of salvation-it is not actually knowing that the Savior is the Redeemer, and that Joseph Smith was his prophet, that will save you and me; but it is the keeping of the commandments of God, living the life of a Latter-day Saint. Heber J. Grant, CR, April 1945.


    51
    No principle pertaining to the Gospel is of greater importance than obedience, for without obedience no blessing can come upon the people. Men my talk all their lives about their faith; but, if they do not obey, they can not obtain the promised blessings. For instance, a man may say that he believes in Jesus and that He is the Son of God; he may believe in baptism and the laying on of hands; but can he get his sins remitted or receive the Holy Ghost if he should not obey baptism or the laying on of hands? George Q. Cannon, Gospel Truth, 121.


    52
    All the knowledge in the world would not amount to anything unless we put that knowledge into actual practice. Heber J. Grant, CR, April 1939, 18.


    53
    It is well to remember that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught. Oscar Wilde, A Few Maxims For The Instruction Of The Over-Educated, Saturday Review, November 17, 1894.


    54
    Knowledge is gained by obedience. It comes by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. In the ultimate and full sense it comes only by revelation from the Holy Ghost. Bruce R. McConkie, “Joseph Smith: A Revealer of Christ,” BYU Fireside, September 1978.


    55
    Contrary to the belief of many, obedience is not the antithesis of freedom, but the foundation of it.

    Tad R. Callister, The Infinite Atonement, 258.


    56
    From an initial experiment thought to be trivial, a vicious cycle may follow. From trial comes a habit. From habit comes dependence. From dependence comes addiction. Its grasp is so gradual. Enslaving shackles of habit are too small to be sensed until they are too strong to be broken. . . . Addiction surrenders later freedom to choose.

    Russell M. Nelson, “Keys of the Priesthood,” Ensign, November 1987, 41.


    57
    There are two influences in the world today, and have been from the beginning. One is an influence that is constructive, that radiates happiness and builds character. The other influence is one that destroys, turns men into demons, tears down and discourages. We are all susceptible to both. The one comes from our Heavenly Father, and the other comes from the source of evil that has been in the world from the beginning, seeking to bring about the destruction of the human family. . . .



    My grandfather used to say to his family, “There is a line of demarcation, well defined, between the Lord’s territory and the devil’s. If you will stay on the Lord’s side of the line you will be under his influence and will have no desire to do wrong; but if you cross to the devil’s side of the line one inch, you are in the tempter’s power, and if he is successful, you will not be able to think or even reason properly, because you will have lost the Spirit of the Lord.



    When I have been tempted sometimes to do a certain thing, I have asked myself, “Which side of the line am I on?” If I determined to be on the safe side, the Lord’s side, I would do the right thing every time. So when temptation comes, think prayerfully about your problem, and the influence of the Spirit of the Lord will enable you to decide wisely. There is safety for us only on the Lord’s side of the line.



    If you want to be happy, remember, that all happiness worthy of the name is on the Lord’s side of the line and all sorrow and disappointment is on the devil’s side of the line. George Albert Smith, Sharing the Gospel with Others, 42-43. 


    58
    Our future is shaped by our past. . . so be very careful what you do in your past! M. Russell Ballard, “Purity Precedes Power,” Ensign, November 1990, 35.


    59
    If we choose the wrong road, we choose the wrong destination. Dallin H. Oaks, “Be Not Deceived,” Ensign, November 2004, 44


    60
    You cannot do wrong and feel right. It is impossible! Ezra Taft Benson, “A Message to the Rising Generation,” Ensign, Nov. 1977, 30.


    61
    The key to leadership is following and it comes from obedience. Boyd K. Packer, June 2002, Mission Presidents Seminar.


    62
    Future success isn’t indicated by church callings or positions of leadership that members hold. The race really isn’t to the swift, that bright star that everyone wishes they could be like. It is to that persistent, plodding, stubbornly obedient individual who toughs it out through thick and thin. James E. Faust, June 2002, Mission Presidents Seminar.


    63
    Obedience qualifies us to know the truth. And then the Holy Ghost sanctifies the human soul, so that we become clean and spotless and eventually are qualified to go where God and Christ are. Bruce R. McConkie, “Jesus Christ and Him Crucified,” BYU Fireside, September 1976. 


    64
    There appear to be immutable laws in the universe that offer both a choice and a consequence, and hence, in this sense, they are spiritual laws. These spiritual laws govern all intelligent beings in the universe—and also govern their progress. For these purposes, progress means an increase in eternal power. In other words, there seem to exist certain immutable laws that will bring power if they are followed or “obeyed,” but if they are neglected or “disobeyed” they may trigger the opposite result. Tad R. Callister, The Infinite Atonement, 301.


    65
    Some might contend that freedom comes when there are no laws or restraints. They contend that freedom in its purest form is the right to do anything, anytime, anywhere, without consequence. Does it not seem ironic that such a philosophy is authored by the master slave himself? It was he who was cast out of heaven, who was deprived of a body, who will be bound a thousand years, and who will ultimately be banished to outer darkness. The freedom he promises is illusory; it is a mirage in the desert; it is the very condition that has always eluded his grasp. Tad R. Callister, The Infinite Atonement, 257.


    66
    Obedience to god’s laws preserves our freedom, flexibility, and ability to achieve our potential. The commandments are not intended to restrict us. Rather, obedience leads to increased spiritual stability and long-term happiness.

    Dale G. Renlund, “Constructing Spiritual Stability,” Religious Educator, Vol 16:1, 3.


    67
    We are too inclined to think of law as something merely restrictive . . . something hemming us in. We sometimes think of law as the opposite of liberty. But that is a false conception. . . . God does not contradict himself. He did not create man and then, as an afterthought, impose upon him a set of arbitrary, irritating, restrictive rules. He made man free—and then gave him the commandments to keep him free. We cannot break the Ten Commandments. We can only break ourselves against them—or else, by keeping them, rise through them to the fullness of freedom under God.   Richard L. Evans, C.R. October 1959, 127.


    Sacrifice

    68
    We begin to love that for which we sacrifice and we begin to sacrifice for what we love. Brad Wilcox, The Continuous Conversion, 159.


    69
    You cannot get the Lord in debt. David O. McKay, The Presidents of the Church, 269


    70
    A person cannot give a crust to the Lord without receiving a loaf in return. Marion G. Romney, C.R., October 1980, 137.


    71
    Can you call it a sacrifice if you give up a handful of dust in return for a whole earth?

    Brigham Young, J.D., 1:114-115.


    72
    So it is that real, personal sacrifice never was placing an animal on the altar. Instead, it is a willingness to put the animal in us upon the altar and letting it be consumed! Such is the "sacrifice unto the Lord . . . of a broken heart and a contrite spirit," a prerequisite to taking up the cross, while giving "away all [our] sins" in order to "know God;" for the denial of self precedes the full acceptance of Him. Neal A. Maxwell, “Deny Yourselves of All Ungodliness,” Ensign, May 1995, 68.


    73
    Christ's great love for us is matched only by His great sacrifice for us. As we sacrifice to draw closer to Him, our love for Him is increased, and as our love grows, we are willing to sacrifice anything for Him . . . . Receiving our endowments ultimately means receiving Christ, accepting His great and last sacrifice and being willing to sacrifice for Him. Brad Wilcox, The Continuous Conversion, 175, 179.


    74
    God requires sacrifice, but for whom? Does He need anything He asks of us? Who needs to be more grateful? Who needs to be turned away from the world and pointed toward heaven? Whose faith and love need to be strengthened and refined? Our sacrifices may be offered to God, but they are not really for Him. He is not trying to see how much He can squeeze out of us, but rather how much He can squeeze into us. . . . The Lord is much more concerned with the offerer than He is with the offering.  Brad Wilcox, The Continuous Conversion, 40-41.


    75
    Our perfect father does not expect us to be perfect children yet. He had only one such Child. Meanwhile, therefore, sometimes with smudges on our cheeks, dirt on our hands, and shoes untied, stammeringly but smilingly we present God with a dandelion---as if it were an orchid or a rose! . . . [and] He receives it. Neal A. Maxwell, Quote Book, 243.


    76
    Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation; for, from the first existence of man, the faith necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained without the sacrifice of all earthly things. It was through this sacrifice, and this only, that God has ordained that men should enjoy eternal life; and it is though the medium of the sacrifice of all earthly things that men do actually know that they are doing the things that are well pleasing in the sight of God. When a man has offered in sacrifice all that he has for the truth’s sake, not even withholding his life, and believing before God that he has been called to make this sacrifice because he seeks to do his will, he does know; most assuredly, that God does and will accept his sacrifice and offering, and that he has not, nor will not seek his face in vain. Under these circumstances, then, he can obtain the faith necessary for him to lay hold on eternal life.

    Joseph Smith, Lectures on Faith, 6:7. 


    Consecration

    77
    There is no doubt if a person lives according to the revelations given to God’s people, he may have the spirit of the Lord to signify to him His will and to guide and to direct him in the discharge of his duties in his temporal as well as his spiritual exercises. I am satisfied, however, that in this respect, we live far beneath our privileges. Discourses of Brigham Young, 32.


    78
    Inasmuch as our will is the only thing that we can, in the long run, really consecrate to God, the Lord needs to know of our willingness to be broken by him. That is, to what degree are we willing to submit, to surrender, to yield our hearts unto him? What happens in the breaking of a horse? Contrary to what many people believe, the horse’s spirit isn’t broken. A well-broken horse remains strong, eager, quick-witted, and aware, and he love to gallop when given free rein. Rather, it is the horse’s independence that is broken. The breaking of a horse results in the horse giving instant obedience to its rider.



    When a child of God is broken, God does not destroy his or her spirit. We don’t lose our zest for living when we come to Christ. We don’t lose the force of our personality. Rather, we lose our independence. Our will is brought into submission to the will of the Father so that we can give instant obedience to the one whom we call Savior and Lord. . . Charles Stanley, The Blessings of Brokeness, 47-48.


    79
    For those who have already strayed from the “strait and narrow” and lost blessings and opportunities they might have had, it is not too late. Do not focus on what you have lost; focus on what you may still accomplish. Sometimes repentant sinners work so diligently and steadily to make up lost ground that they may actually surpass those Saints who have never wandered far from the path but who have never “lengthened their stride” either. Brent L. Top, Forgiveness, Christ’s Priceless Gift, 136.


    80
    There is no one great thing that man can do and then do no more and obtain salvation. After entering into the kingdom of God, . . . it is by learning “precept upon precept; line upon line; here a little and there a little,” that salvation will be made secure. It is by resisting temptation today, overcoming a weakness tomorrow, forsaking evil associations the next day, and thus day by day, month after month, year after year, pruning, restraining and weeding out that which is evil in the disposition, that the character is purged of its imperfections. Salvation is a matter of character-building under the Gospel laws and ordinances, and more especially with the direct aid of the Holy Spirit.



    Nor is it enough that one get rid of evil. He must do good. He must surround himself with circumstances congenial to the sensitive nature of the Holy Ghost, that he may not be offended, and withdraw himself; for if he does so, amen to the man’s spiritual or moral development. He must cultivate noble sentiments by performing noble deeds—not great ones, necessarily, for opportunity to do what the world esteems great things, comes but seldom to men in the ordinary walks of life; but noble deeds may be done every day; and every such deed performed with an eye single to the glory of God, draws one that much nearer into harmony with Deity. B.H. Roberts, The Gospel and Man’s Relationship to Deity, 197-198.


    81
    We must put God in the forefront of everything else in our lives. He must come first, just as He declares in the first of His Ten Commandments: ‘Thou shalt have no other gods before me.’ (Exodus 20:3). When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives. Our love of the Lord will govern the claims for our affection, the demands on our time, the interests we pursue, and the order of our priorities. We should put God ahead of everyone else in our lives. Ezra Taft Benson, Great Commandment, 4.


    82
    In modern revelation we are told very frankly that “when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.” I don’t know how it is for you, but I have felt so often in my life so greatly blessed for what little obedience I have given. My conclusion with regard to that verse is that the Lord’s ration of blessings to our obedience is a very generous ration indeed. He is so quick to reward us, so quick to reassure us, and so anxious to take delight when we serve Him. So if you puzzle over that verse, as I have in life, the only bottom line I can give you is that the ration of blessings to our minuscule obedience is a very, very generous ratio indeed. Neal A. Maxwell, “Sharing Insights From My Life,” BYU Devotional, January 12, 1999.


    83
    The submission of one's will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God's altar. It is a hard doctrine, but it is true. The many other things we give to God, however nice that may be of us, are actually things He has already given us, and He has loaned them to us. But when we begin to submit ourselves by letting our wills be swallowed up in God's will, then we are really giving something to Him. And that hard doctrine lies at the center of discipleship. There is a part of us that is ultimately sovereign, the mind and heart, where we really do decide which way to go and what to do. And when we submit to His will, then we've really given Him the one thing He asks of us. And the other things are not very, very important. It is the only possession we have that we can give, and there is no resulting shortage in our agency as a result. Instead, what we see is a flowering of our talents and more and more surges of joy. Submission to Him is the only form of submission that is completely safe. Neal A. Maxwell, “Swallowed Up in the Will of the Father,” BYU Devotional, January 1999. 


    84
    One’s individual will thus remains uniquely his. God will not override it nor overwhelm it. Hence we’d better want the consequences of what we want!



    Another cosmic fact: only by aligning our wills with God’s is full happiness to be found. Anything less results in a lesser portion.



    Progression toward submission confers another blessing: an enhanced capacity for joy. If you want to enjoy exquisitely, become a Latter-day Saint, and then live the doctrine of Jesus Christ. Neal A. Maxwell, “According to the Desire of Our Heart,” Ensign, November 1995, 23-24. 


    85
    Desire denotes a real longing or craving. Hence righteous desires are much more than passive preferences or fleeting feelings.



    Therefore, what we insistently desire, over time, is what we will eventually become and what we will receive in eternity.



    Like it or not, therefore, reality requires that we acknowledge our responsibility for our desires. Brothers and sisters, which do we really desire, God’s plans for us or Satan’s?



    It is up to us. God will facilitate, but He will not force. Neal A. Maxwell, “According to the Desire of Our Heart,” Ensign, November 1996, 21-22.


    86
    Do you think that people will obey the truth because it is true, unless they love it? No, they will not. Thus knowing gospel truths and doctrines is profoundly important, but we must also come to love them. When we love them, they will move us and help our desires and outward works to become more holy. Neal A. Maxwell, “According to the Desire of Our Heart,” Ensign, November 1996, 22.


    87
    Consecration is the only surrender that is also a victory. Neal A. Maxwell, “According to the Desire of Our Heart,” Ensign, November 1992, 66.


    88
    Consecration is not shoulder-shrugging acceptance, but, instead, shoulder-squaring to better bear the yoke. . . It would change the entire Church if in every ward, we could have just three or four more families who became truly consecrated disciples of Jesus Christ instead of just being active in the Church. Neal A. Maxwell, “Swallowed Up in the Will of the Father,” Ensign, Nov. 1995, 24.


    89
    To do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all mankind, is the truest greatness.

    Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine, 285.
