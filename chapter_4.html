                    God and Christ have been victorious and Satan and his followers have been thwarted at each essential turning point except one---the turning point in our individual lives. Satan cannot undo the Creation, the Fall, the Atonement, or the Restoration. He cannot pull them down, so instead he tries to pull us down.

                    Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it, and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.

                    As God has designed our happiness—and the happiness of all His creatures, He never has—He never will institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people that is not calculated in its nature to promote that happiness which He has designed, and which will not end in the greatest amount of good and glory to those who become the recipients of His law and ordinances.

                    So many people seek to invent some sort of happiness for themselves outside God, apart from God. And out of that hopeless attempt has come nearly all that we call human history---money, poverty, ambition, war, prostitution, classes, slavery---the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy. . . . God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing.

                    The nearer man approaches perfection the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till he has overcome the evils of his life and lost every desire for sin; and like the ancients, arrived at that point of faith where he is wrapped in the power and glory of his maker and is caught up to dwell with Him. But we consider that this is a station to which no man ever arrived in a moment.

                    Although we sometimes hear it said that there were two plans---Christ's plan of freedom and agency, and Lucifer's of slavery and compulsion---such teaching does not conform to the revealed word. Christ did not present a plan of redemption and salvation, nor did Lucifer. There were not two plans up for consideration; there was only one; and that was the plan of the Father: originated, developed, presented, and put in force by him. Christ, however, made the plan his own by his willing obedience to its terms and provisions. . . . Always it is the Father's plan; always the Son is the obedient co-worker.

                    One of the saddest examples of a misconceived and twisted knowledge of an otherwise glorious concept is all the all-too-common heresy that there were two plans of salvation; that the Father (presumptively at a loss to know what to do) asked others for proposals; that Christ offered a plan involving agency and Lucifer proposed a plan denying agency; that the Father chose between them; and that Lucifer, his plan being rejected, rebelled, and then there was war in heaven.<br><br>
                    Even a cursory knowledge of the overall scheme of things reassures spiritually discerning persons that all things center in the Father; that the plan of salvation which he designed was to save his children, Christ included; and that neither Christ nor Lucifer could of themselves save anyone . . . .<br><br>
                    There is, of course, a sense in which we may refer to Lucifer's proposed modifications of the Father's plan as Lucifer's plan, and Christ made the Father's plan his own by adoption. But what is basically important in this respect is to know that the power to save is vested in the Father, and that he originated, ordained, created, and established his own plan; that he announced it to his children; and that he then asked for a volunteer to be the Redeemer, the Deliverer, the Messiah, who would put the eternal plan of the Eternal Father into eternal operation.

                    We do not "earn" our estates, we keep them. Salvation in any form (not just physical death) is not something we earn---it has already been given to us. The only issue to decide is if we will hold on to this precious gift and endowment. . . . True it is that when we inherit something it isn't earned---it is a free gift given; however, even though we don't earn an inheritance, we can, if we are not careful, disinherit ourselves through disobedience and unrepented sins.

                    There are certain eternal laws by which the Gods in the eternal worlds are governed and which they cannot violate, and do not want to violate. These eternal principles must be kept, and one principle is that no unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of God.

                    There appear to be immutable laws in the universe that offer both a choice and a consequence, and hence, in this sense, they are spiritual laws. These spiritual laws govern all intelligent beings in the universe—and also govern their progress. For these purposes, progress means an increase in eternal power. In other words, there seem to exist certain immutable laws that will bring power if they are followed or “obeyed,” but if they are neglected or “disobeyed,” they may trigger the opposite result.

                    God has in reserve a time . . . when He will bring His subjects, who have obeyed His voice and kept His commandments, into His celestial rest. This rest is of such perfection and glory, that man has need of a preparation before he can, according to the laws of that kingdom, enter it and enjoy its blessings. This being the fact, God has given certain laws to the human family, which, if observed, are sufficient to prepare them to inherit this rest. This, then, we conclude, was the purpose of God in giving His laws to us.

                    The Gospel principles are everlasting. Truth was not created, nor can it be. Faith and repentance were not called into existence. They are eternal principles, adapted to the needs of man and the purposes of Deity. The Supreme Intelligence, recognizing these principles as ennobling and exalting in their nature, made use of them as the most effective means for man’s promotion.

                    It is just as impossible for God to add two and two together and make ten of it as it is for me or you. Mathematical truths are as true with God and angels as they are with man. I understand that what has exalted to life and salvation our Father in heaven and all the Gods of eternity will also exalt us, their children. And what causes Lucifer and his followers to descend to the regions of death and perdition will also lead us in the same direction; and no atonement of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ can alter that eternal law, any more than he can make two and two to mean sixteen.

                    Mortality is a time of self-determination, spiritual growth and gaining experience, knowledge and wisdom. It is a test of our personal faith and action in an environment allowing each one complete freedom to become precisely what we desire to become! The range of possibilities here are as vast as intelligence itself. Human capacities for good or evil are matched in perfect mirror-image symmetry. While there is boundless creativity and growth on the one hand, insatiable depravity and destruction lie on the other. Every man and every woman must be allowed to make these decisions in an environment free from the imposing memory of that world in which we lived. To allow memory of our preexistence here would “skew” the results as badly as having an answer sheet as we take a test.

                    Man’s accountability for his individual acts is as complete as is his agency to elect for himself. The ultimate result of good deeds is happiness, the consequence of evil is misery; these follow in every man’s life by inviolable laws. There is a plan of judgment divinely foreordained, by which every man will be called to answer for his deeds; and not for deeds alone but for his words also and even for the thoughts of his heart. . .



                    The execution of judgment is not always made to follow the acts of men immediately; good deeds may not be at once rewarded, nor evil be peremptorily punished; and this is according to divine wisdom, for were it otherwise the test of individual character and the trial of human faith, for which purposes this mortal probation was primarily ordained, would be greatly lessened; as the certainty of immediate pleasure or pain would largely determine human acts to secure the one and avoid the other. Judgment, therefore, is postponed, that every one may prove himself; the good man increasing in righteousness, and the evil-doer having opportunity for repentance and reparation.

                    Two principles come into collision in God’s plan for human progression. Moral agency is predicated on a causal connection between choice and consequence. Given the freedom to choose, individuals must be granted the fruits of their choices, good or ill, or such freedom would be only a shadow of genuine agency. Given the uneven playing field called earth, where our untempered spirits contend against bodily weakness, myriad pressures and temptations, and the soul’s own imperfect desires, sin is inevitable—and so therefore are its consequences. The inevitability of sin means the inevitability of sinful human natures, and consequent alienation from God, and His heaven. But in His infinite love and compassion, God wills the reintegration of every individual into the heavenly family. The human freedom to sin thus collides with God’s desire to save. The problem of how to reconcile this tragic collision is the problem of atonement.

                    We know that true freedom is not possible unless the results of the choices are different. Since freedom only exists when the results of alternative choices are different, it stands to reason that one gains more freedom as the result between choices become more and more different. This being the case, we have the most freedom when the results of our choices are opposite. Thus we are not only free to choose between “the way of everlasting death” and “the way of eternal life,” but without “the way of everlasting death” as an option, we would not really be free to choose at all. . .<br><br>
                    The belief that Satan’s plan was to force us to be righteous feeds a misunderstanding about freedom. Some wrongly suppose that agency is no more than the right to choose, and that this right is not only universal, but also without condition. They therefore conclude that agency must also be without penalty. From there, it is mistakenly assumed that anyone administering a penalty for a bad choice is violating someone’s agency. . .<br><br>
                    Since we cannot have law without penalty and it is laws that make us free, we cannot have freedom without the possibility of penalty. To have freedom we must have different results from our choices, including penalties. Spiritual freedom then is created by having different results from our choices. Thus the principle of having “opposition in all things” applies not only to having opposite choices but to having opposite results as well.<br><br>
                    The diabolical brilliance of Satan’s plan now becomes clear. If our freedom is destroyed by having a situation which brings only penalty and no reward (no atonement, no forgiveness) then the reverse situation must destroy freedom as well (universal salvation, “one soul shall not be lost”). If we eliminate the option of penalty and thus have only rewards as the result of every choice, then different results would not exist and freedom would also be lost. This is the key to Satan’s plan. By this means comes the destruction of freedom, and therefore the destruction of the agency of man (accountability). We must be free to lose or we cannot be free to choose.

                    There is nothing fun about repentance, so the natural man prefers to avoid it. He prefers to make his own rules. . . . If repentance is not required, few believers will do much repenting because it is so difficult. Most will skip the tough part because they believe they are saved anyway. Why bother struggling to climb a mountain if someone offers to give you a free ride to the top? The grace only doctrine claims to save people in their sins, thus destroying accountability by withholding any penalty and granting an unconditional reward. This “saved by grace” doctrine is not far from Satan’s freedom plan.<br><br>
                    Accountability, or stewardship, was the principle which we fought to preserve in the War in Heaven, although scripture uses the word agency to describe it. The problem for us is that this war has come to earth and Satan’s plan has not changed.

                    God is doing all that can be done, given the nature of things, to help us overcome evil as we progress in the struggle with it; he in no sense created evil in order to do that, but in choosing to help us progress God had to bring us into a condition where there were new things to learn and choices to be made. That condition, unavoidably, is one where evil results from our imperfections and imperfect choices. And God only takes on such a responsibility because he has the immense power to provide absolutely sufficient means, here and hereafter, so that he can assure each of us that the evil can be overcome, if we will.

                    I dare say that in the spirit world, when it was proposed to us to come into this probation, and pass through the experience that we are now receiving, it was not altogether pleasant and agreeable; the prospects were not so delightful in all respects as might have been desired. Yet there is no doubt that we saw and understood clearly there that, in order to accomplish our exaltation and glory, this was a necessary experience; and however disagreeable it might have appeared to us, we were willing to conform to the will of God, and consequently we are here.

                    Some might ask when faced with suffering, how could Almighty God let this happen? And then that seemingly inevitable question, why did this happen to me? Why must we experience disease and events that disable or call precious family members home early or extend their years in pain? Why the heartaches? At these moments we can turn to the great plan of happiness authored by a Heavenly Father. That plan, when presented in the pre-earth life, prompted us all to shout for joy. Put simply, this life is training for eternal exaltation, and that process means tests and trials. It has always been so, and no one is spared.

                    The severance of family ties through death is of all things most painful, bringing with it an avalanche of emotions, including loneliness and sorrow. Those of the household of faith are not spared such feelings. He who knows all things and has a present view of all time and eternity, even He is aware of such agonies. We weep and we long for a reassociation, but we do not grieve as those who have no hope for to do so is to express a lack of faith in the purposes and the plan of God and to ignore the promise of reunion and restoration given by our Lord and Savior. Indeed, life’s bitter winters may find us walking alone. During these cold and dark seasons of solitude, we wrap ourselves in the protective clothing of faith and its perspective and are warmed by precious memories. Thus we move on, seeking always to view things as God views them.

                    Remember this! The line “And they lived happily ever after” is never written into the second act [of a play]. That line belongs in the third act, when the mysteries are solved and everything is put right. Do not suppose that God willfully causes that which, for his own purposes, he permits. When you know the plan and purpose of it all even these things will manifest a loving Father in Heaven.

                    You parents of the wilful and the wayward! Don’t give them up. Don’t cast them off. They are not utterly lost. The Shepherd will find his sheep. They were his before they were yours–long before he entrusted them to your care; and you cannot begin to love them as he loves them. They have but strayed in ignorance from the Path of Right, and God is merciful to ignorance. Only the fulness of knowledge brings the fulness of accountability. Our Heavenly Father is far more merciful, infinitely more charitable, than even the best of his servants, and the Everlasting Gospel is mightier in power to save than our narrow finite minds can comprehend.<br><br>
                    The Prophet Joseph Smith declared–and he never taught more comforting doctrine–that the eternal sealings of faithful parents and the divine promises made to them for valiant service in the Cause of Truth, would save not only themselves, but likewise their posterity. Though some of the sheep may wander, the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold. Either in this life or in the life to come, they will return. They will have to pay their debt to justice; they will suffer for their sins; and may tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last, like the penitent Prodigal, to a loving and forgiving father’s heart and home, the painful experience will not have been in vain. Pray for your careless and disobedient children; hold on to them with your faith. Hope on, trust on, till you see the salvation of God.

                    A principle in this statement (Orson F. Whitney) that is often overlooked is that they must fully repent and ‘suffer for their sins’ and ‘pay their debt to justice.’ I recognize that now is the time ‘to prepare to meet God.’ If the repentance of the wayward children does not happen in this life, is it still possible for the cords of the sealing to be strong enough for them yet to work out their repentance? We remember that the prodigal son wasted his inheritance, and when it was all gone he came back to his father’s house. There he was welcomed back into the family, but his inheritance was spent. Mercy will not rob justice, and the sealing power of faithful parents will only claim wayward children upon the condition of their repentance and Christ’s Atonement. Repentant wayward children will enjoy salvation and all the blessings that go with it, but exaltation is much more. It must be fully earned. The question as to who will be exalted must be left to the Lord in His mercy.

                    Baptism isn't the end. The temple isn't the end. The Second Coming isn't the end. Even the celestial kingdom isn't the end. They are all means to the real end, which is for each of us to become like God and Christ. We may be content to stay as we are and let others stay as they are, but Heavenly Father has a much different plan in mind. . . .<br><br>
                    If our whole goal were just to be in God's presence again, why would we have left it in the first place? We were already with God in the premortal existence, but were painfully aware that we were not like Him physically or spiritually. We wanted to be like our Heavenly Parents and knew it was going to take a lot more than just dressing up in their clothes as little children do. We needed to fill their shoes---not just clomp around in them. The Atonement reconciles us with God so that we can again be with Him and enjoy sweet association, but how sweet can that association be if we remain unchanged? The goal is not just being with God, but being like God.

We know, however, that there is something called intelligence which always existed. It is the real eternal part of man, which was not created nor made. This intelligence combined with the spirit constitutes a spiritual identity or individual.

                    All men and women are in the similitude of the universal Father and Mother, and are literally the sons and daughters of Deity. . . . The doctrine of the pre-existence, — revealed so plainly, particularly in the latter days, pours a wonderful flood of light upon the otherwise mysterious problems of man’s origin. It shows that man, as a spirit, was begotten and born of heavenly parents, and reared to maturity in the eternal mansions of the Father, prior to coming upon the earth in a temporal body to undergo an experience in mortality. It teaches that all men existed in the spirit before any man existed in the flesh, and that all who have inhabited the earth since Adam have taken bodies and become souls in like manner. . . .<br><br>
                    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, basing its belief on divine revelation, ancient and modern, proclaims man to be the direct and lineal offspring of Deity. God Himself is an exalted man, perfected, enthroned, and supreme. . . .<br><br>
                    Man is the child of God, formed in the divine image and endowed with divine attributes, and even as the infant son of an earthly father and mother is capable in due time of becoming a man, so the undeveloped offspring of celestial parentage is capable, by experience through ages and aeons, of evolving into a God.

                    Here, then, is eternal life —to know the only wise and true God; and you have got to learn how to be Gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all gods have done before you, namely, by going from one small degree to another, and from a small capacity to a great one; from grace to grace, from exaltation to exaltation, until you attain to the resurrection of the dead, and are able to dwell in everlasting burnings, and to sit in glory, as do those who sit enthroned in everlasting power. . . . To inherit the same power, the same glory and he same exaltation, until you arrive at the station of a God, and ascend the throne of eternal power, the same as those who have gone before.<br><br>
                    What did Jesus do? Why; I do the things I was my Father do when worlds came rolling into existence. My Father worked out his kingdom with fear and trembling, and I must do the same; and when I get my kingdom, I shall present it to my Father, so that he may obtain kingdom upon kingdom, and it will exalt him in glory. He will then take a higher exaltation, and I will take his place, and thereby become exalted myself. So that Jesus treads in the tracks of his Father, and inherits what God did before; and God is thus glorified and exalted in the salvation and exaltation of all his children.<br><br>
                    When you climb up a ladder, you must begin at the bottom, and ascend step by step, until you arrive at the top; and so it is with the principles of the Gospel —you must begin with the first, and go on until you learn all the principles of exaltation. But it will be a great while after you have passed through the veil before you will have learned them. It is not all to be comprehended in this world; it will be a great work to learn our salvation and exaltation even beyond the grave.

Since every living thing follows the pattern of its parentage, are we to suppose that God had some other strange pattern in mind for His offspring? Surely we, His children, are not, in the language of science, a different species than He is. What is in error, then, when we use the term godhood to describe the ultimate destiny of mankind?

I want to tell you, each and every one of you, that you are well acquainted with God our heavenly Father, or the great Elohim. You are all well acquainted with Him, for there is not a soul of you but what has lived in His house and dwelt with Him year after year; and yet you are seeking to become acquainted with Him, when the fact is, you have merely forgotten what you did know.

Men are the offspring or children of the Gods, and destined to advance by degrees, and to make their way by a progressive series of changes, till they become like their father in heaven, and like Jesus Christ their elder brother. Thus perfected, the whole family will . . . continue to organize, people, redeem, and perfect other systems which are now in the womb of Chaos.

As God took pre-existent matter and shaped it into the earth, so does he take primordial intelligences, father them into spirits, and mentor them into divinity. As the chaos of matter becomes earth, planets, and star systems, the scattered children of God are assimilated into eternal marriages, families, and heavenly dynasties. They then become co-participants with God in his ongoing purposes: fashioning worlds and creating endless posterity, eternally working to impose order and form on an infinitely malleable cosmos.

As more knowledge and power are attained, growth becomes increasingly more rapid. God, exalted by his glorious intelligence, is moving on into new fields of power with a rapidity of which we can have no conception, whereas man, in a lower stage of development, moves relatively at a snail-like, though increasing pace. Man is, nevertheless, moving on, in eternal progression. In short, man is a god in embryo. He comes of a race of gods, and as this eternal growth is continued, we will approach more nearly the point which to us is Godhood.

In each of us is the potentiality to become a god. We learn from the scriptures that each of us has an eternal existence, that we were in the beginning with God. And understanding this gives to us a unique sense of man’s dignity.<br><br>
I would emphasize that the teachings of Christ that we should become perfect were not mere rhetoric. He meant literally that it is the right of mankind to become like the Father and like the Son, having overcome human weaknesses and developed attributes of divinity.<br><br>
[Even though] many individuals do not fully use the capacity that is in them, [that] does nothing to negate the truth that they have the power to become Christlike. It is the man and woman who use the power who prove its existence; neglect cannot prove its absence. . .<br><br>
Man can transform himself and he must. Man has in himself the seeds of godhood, which can germinate and grow and develop. As the acorn becomes the oak, the mortal man becomes a god. It is within his power to lift himself by his very bootstraps from the plane on which he finds himself to the plane on which he should be. It may be a long, hard lift with many obstacles, but it is a real possibility. . . . <br><br>

There are many who believe that we are the spirit creations of God, just as a building is the creation of its architect or a painting the creation of its painter or an invention the creation of its inventor. The scriptures, however, teach a much different doctrine. They teach that we are more than creations of God; they teach that we are the literal spirit offspring or children of God our Father. Why is this distinction important? The difference is monumental in its consequence because our identity determines in large measure our destiny. For example, can a mere creation ever become like its creator? Can a building ever become an architect? A painting a painter? Or an invention an inventor? If not, then those who believe we are creations of God, rather than His spirit offspring, reach the inevitable conclusion that we do not have the capacity to become like our Father in Heaven. In essence, their doctrine of identity has defined and dictated a diminished destiny.<br><br>
On the other hand, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we believe that we are the spirit offspring of God and thus have inherited spiritual traits that give us the divine potential to become like Him. . .<br><br>
If we do not correctly understand our divine identity as a son or daughter of God, then we will never correctly understand our divine destiny. They are, in truth, inseparable partners.

Do not the laws of science teach us that like begets like, each after its kind? Science has taught us that a complex genetic code transferred from parent to child is responsible for the child attaining the physical attributes of his or her parents. If this be so, is it not logical to assume that spirit offspring receive a spiritual code giving to them the divine characteristics and potential of their parent—God.

Human beings are not “in essence” separate creations apart from their Creator. They are literally God’s spirit sons and daughters. Though we are at present infinitely less than God is, we are not a different species. Rather, we are descended from Gods, divine Parents, and are potential possessors of the divine nature. The difference between God and man is great, but it is one of degree, not of type or kind. . .<br><br>
We ourselves will, if exalted, be given what the Father possesses, an exalted status with the kind of physical body he now has, and will do the things he now does.

The difference between man and God is significant, but it is one of degree, not kind. It is the difference between an acorn and an oak tree, a rosebud and a rose, a son and a father. In truth, every man is a god in embryo, in fulfillment of that eternal law that like begets like. To suggest otherwise is to suggest that God created inferior offspring, in direct conflict with every scientific law know to man. But somehow, most of the world continues to miss the mark.

Who is greater: that being who limits or that being who enhances man’s eternal progress? One might ask, Who can give greater honor and glory to God—a creature of lower or more exalted status? Can an animal offer the same honor or worship with the same passion and intensity as a human? Can a mere mortal express the empyreal [celestial, sublime] feelings or exercise the spiritual fervency of a potential god? One’s capacity to honor and worship is magnified with one’s intellectual, emotional, cultural, and spiritual enlightenment. Accordingly, the more we become like God, the greater our ability to pay Him homage. In that process of lifting men heavenward, God simultaneously multiplies His own honor and glory and thus is glorified more, not less.

Much is made, particularly by critics of the Church, about the Latter-day Saint belief that men and woman can become as God is. Although our Heavenly Father has not chosen to make known a great deal about this distinctive teaching, there are some things we do know. While the revelations declare that becoming like God is entailed in eternal life, we do not believe we will ever, worlds without end, unseat or oust God the Eternal Father or his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ; those holy beings are and forever will be the Gods we worship.

The whole design of the gospel is to lead us onward and upward to greater achievement, even, eventually, to godhood. Our enemies have criticized us for believing in this. Our reply is that this lofty concept in no way diminishes God the Eternal Father. He is the Almighty. He is the Creator and Governor of the universe. He is the greatest of all and will always be so. But just as any earthly father wishes for his sons and daughters every success in life, so I believe our Father in Heaven wishes for his children that they might approach him in stature and stand beside him resplendent in godly strength and wisdom.

God said (in the Bible) that we were ‘gods’ and He is going to make good his words. If we let Him—for we can prevent Him, if we choose—He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a god or goddess, dazzling, radiant, immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine, a bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly (though, of course, on a smaller scale) His own boundless power and delight and goodness. The process will be long and in parts very painful; but that is what we are in for. Nothing less. He meant what He said.

The first great principle that ought to occupy the attention of all mankind, that should be understood by the child and the adult, and which is the main spring of all actions (whether people understand it or not), is the principle of improvement. The principle of increase, of exaltation, of adding to that we already possess, is the grand moving principle and cause of the actions of the children of men . . . the main spring of the actions of [all] people. . . . Those who profess to be Latter-day Saints, who have the privilege of receiving and understanding the principles of the holy Gospel, are in duty bound to study and find out, and put in practice in their lives, those principles that are calculated to endure, and that tend to a continual increase in this, and in the world to come. All their earthly avocations should be framed upon this principle. This alone can insure to them an exaltation: this is the starting point, in this existence, to an endless progression.

Whether or not in the great future, full of so many possibilities now hidden from us, they of the lesser glories after education and advancement within those spheres may at last emerge from them and make their way to the higher degrees of glory until at last they attain to the highest, is not revealed in the revelations of God, and any statement made on the subject must partake more or less of the nature of conjecture. But if it be granted that such a thing is possible, they who at the first entered into the Celestial glory—having before them the privilege also of eternal progress—have been moving onward, so that the relative distance between them and those who have fought their way up from the lesser glories may be as great when the latter have come into the degrees of Celestial glory in which the righteous at first stood, as it was at the commencement. Thus: Those whose faith and works are such only as to enable them to inherit a Telestial glory, may arrive at last where those whose works in this life were such as to enable them to entrance into the Celestial kingdom. They may arrive where these were, but never where they are.

I am not a strict constructionist, believing that we seal our eternal progress by what we do here. It is my belief that God will save all of His children that he can: and while, if we live unrighteously here, we shall not go to the other side in the same status, so to speak, as those who lived righteously; nevertheless, the unrighteous will have their chance, and in the eons of the eternities that are to follow, they, too, may climb to the destinies to which they who are righteous and serve God, have climbed to those eternities that are to come.

Intelligence, purity, truth, will always remain with us relative terms and also relative qualities. Ascend to what heights you may, ever beyond you will see other heights in respect of these things and ever as you ascend, more heights will appear, and it is doubtful if we shall ever attain the absolute in respect of these qualities. Our joy will be the joy of approximating them, of attaining unto ever-increasing excellence without attaining the absolute. It will be the joy of eternal progression.

We can still improve, we are made for that purpose, our capacities are organized to expand until we can receive into our comprehension celestial knowledge and wisdom, and to continue worlds without end. . . . if men can understand and receive it, mankind are organized to receive intelligence until they become perfect in the sphere they are appointed to fill, which is far ahead of us at present. When we use the term perfection, it applies to man in his present condition, as well as the heavenly beings. We are now, or may be, as perfect in our sphere as God and angels are in theirs, but the greatest intelligence in existence can continually ascend to greater heights of perfection.

No theology could be more optimistic than one that proclaims humankind’s infinite potential. The best reward for a well-lived life is eternal progression, not eternal bliss. Mormon theology is the American dream writ large. It is also a call to action in the here-and-now, for we will take with us the tools that we have acquired and sharpened during this life and continue to use and improve them in the next.

There are some people who have supposed that if we are quickened telestial bodies, that eventually, throughout the ages of eternity, we will continue to progress until we will find our place in the celestial kingdom, but the scriptures and revelations of God have said that those who are quickened telestial bodies cannot come where God and Christ dwell, worlds without end.

The Brethren direct me to say that the Church has never announced a definite doctrine upon this point (Progression from one kingdom to the other after the resurrection). Some of the Brethren have held the view that it was possible in the course of progression to advance from one glory to another, invoking the principle of eternal progression; others of the Brethren have taken an opposite view. But, as stated, the Church has never announced a definite doctrine on this point.
