                    Which of the founders of major world religions declared himself to be divine? Buddha did not. Muhammad did not. Nor did Lao-tzu, Confucius, Abraham, or Moses. Only one religious leader made such a claim and then backed it up by the way He lived, the things He taught, and the miracles He performed---Jesus Christ.<br><br>
                    Did any of these leaders claim the willingness or power to be able to suffer and atone for the sins of the world? Did Buddha or Muhammad? Did the founders of Hinduism or Shintoism? No. The only one who claimed such a thing and actually completed it was Jesus Christ.

                    In considering how we as mortals are to rise above our fallen nature, we might be tempted to search for a program, a procedure, a formula of some kind. Given how long human beings have lived on the planet, surely by now the solution to this age-old problem of overcoming the effects of the Fall is somewhere to be found. The wisest among us soon discover, however, that the answer is not in a book, even a holy book. It is not to be found in a course in behavior modification, nor can the goal of a righteous life be achieved by sheer grit and willpower. The solution is to be found in a Person, a holy Person, a Being with powers and abilities far beyond what any of us as earth's inhabitants can create or conjure. The answer is to be found---the solution is to be discovered only---in the man Jesus, called the Christ or Anointed One, the Atoning One.</p>

                    Surely part of coming to know our Lord and Savior is coming to know who he is and what he as done. The more we learn of him---the more we search the prophets and pore over the revelations---the more it becomes clear that there are two grand attitudes that we must develop toward Jesus Christ, perspectives or points of view that seem to be almost in tension, perhaps even in opposition to one another. The first is this: the growing realization that Jesus Christ is God; that, under the direction of the Father, he is the Creator and Governor of all things; that his redemptive labors were infinite and eternal in scope; that he has power over life and death, power over the very elements that make up our world and an infinite number of other worlds; that he is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.<br><br>
                    The second attitude is a growing desire to be close to him, to spend time with him, to enjoy communion with him. . . . Thus when we speak of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the greatest act of mercy and love in all eternity, we must of necessity speak of that intercession, that reconciliation as being both infinite and intimate.

                    What you sincerely in your heart think of Christ will determine what you are and will largely determine what your acts will be.

                    For many years I have felt and seen the need for an organizing principle in life, a principle that would enable us to get a handle on things—unravel confusion, clarify relationships, get to the bottom line fast. The principle would have to be simple but not simplistic. It must also be capable of serving as the directing or controlling center of a person’s life. . . . What does it mean to put Christ at the center of one’s life? The sense of this is seeing our world through the eyes of Christ, with the intent of reaching for his map, his frame of reference.</p>

                    Under the Father’s great eternal plan, it is the Savior who suffered. It is the Savior who broke the bands of death.

                    There is no amorphous entity called “the Atonement” upon which we may call for succor, healing, forgiveness, or power. Jesus Christ is the source. Sacred terms such as Atonement and Resurrection describe what the Savior did, according to the Father’s plan, so that we may live with hope in this life and gain eternal life in the world to come. The Savior’s atoning sacrifice—the central act of all human history—is best understood and appreciated when we expressly and clearly connect it to Him.

                    For many Christians the greatness of Christ’s Atonement is demonstrated by emphasizing human sin and the immense distance that exists between us and God. For Latter-day Saints the greatness of Christ’s Atonement is illustrated by emphasizing human potential and the incredible closeness that can exist between us and God. Christ’s greatest salvation is seen in His willingness to interact with us as we develop His celestial attributes.</p>

                    The word Atonement describes the setting “at one” of those who have been estranged, and denotes the reconciliation of man to God. Sin is the cause of the estrangement, and therefore the purpose of atonement is to correct or overcome the consequences of sin. . .<br><br>
                    Jesus Christ, as the Only Begotten Son of God and the only sinless person to live on this earth, was the only one capable of making an atonement for mankind. By his selection and foreordination in the Grand Council before the world was formed, his divine Sonship, his sinless life, the shedding of his blood in the garden of Gethsemane, his death on the cross and subsequent bodily resurrection from the grave, he made a perfect atonement for all mankind. All are covered unconditionally as pertaining to the fall of Adam. Hence all shall rise from the dead with immortal bodies, because of Jesus’ atonement. The atonement is conditional, however, so far as each person’s individual sins are concerned, and touches every one to the degree that he has faith in Jesus Christ, repents of his sins, and obeys the gospel.</p>

                    Some things simply matter more than others. Even some doctrines, though interesting and even fun to discuss, must take a back seat to more fundamental and foundational doctrines.

                    Now let us suppose a modern-day case. Suppose we have the scriptures, the gospel, the priesthood, the Church, the ordinances, the organization, even the keys of the kingdom – everything that now is down to the last jot and tittle – and yet there is no atonement of Christ. What then? Can we be saved? Will all our good works save us? Will we be rewarded for all our righteousness? Most assuredly we will not.<br><br>
                    We are not saved by works alone, no matter how good; we are saved because God sent his Son to shed his blood in Gethsemane and on Calvary “that all thru him might ransomed be”.<br><br>
                    We are saved by the blood of Christ. To paraphrase Abinadi: “Salvation doth not come by the Church alone: and were it not for the atonement, given by the grace of God as a free gift, all men must unavoidably perish, and this notwithstanding the Church and all that appertains to it.”</p>

The reason is straightforward: he was the only one of the Father’s children who came to earth with infinitely divine qualities and thus possessed the infinite power necessary to perform the atoning act. Anyone else simply did not have the power and means to overcome physical and spiritual death.

                    The atonement was plainly to be a vicarious sacrifice, voluntary and love-inspired on the Savior’s part, universal in its application to mankind so far as men shall accept the means of deliverance thus placed within their reach. For such a mission only one who was without sin could be eligible. . . . Jesus Christ was the only Being suited to the requirements of the great sacrifice:<br><br>

These obstacles include physical death; sin and its consequences; our weaknesses and imperfections; and the common ailments of life, such as rejection, depression, loneliness, and illness. The Savior’s Atonement can ultimately rescue us from every condition that prevents us from becoming like God—hence His title as the Savior of all mankind.<br><br>
                    The Atonement required a being who had infinite love, infinite power, and infinite capacity to suffer. Only a perfect being—only the Savior—had these qualities, and thus He was the only hope to save us. He performed the Atonement by exercising those attributes and powers in the Garden of Gethsemane, on the cross of Calvary, and in the tomb of Arimathaea.

                    There are at least three principal purposes of the Atonement:<br><br>
                    First: To restore all that was lost by the fall of Adam. This was done by (1) bringing about the resurrection for all men, thus overcoming physical death and (2) restoring all men to the presence of God for the purpose of being judged, thus overcoming what the scriptures call a first spiritual death. Both of these deaths were imposed upon all men because of Adam; both of these deaths were overcome for all men through Christ.<br><br>
                    Second: To provide for the possibility of repentance so that men might be cleansed from their individual sins and by so doing overcome what the scriptures call a second spiritual death.<br><br>
                    Third: To provide the power necessary to exalt us to the status of a god.<br><br>
                    These three purposes are designed to help us permanently return to God’s presence and become like Him.<br><br>

                    The Savior’s earthly experience can be conveniently divided into three categories, namely his message, his ministry, and his mission. Only the events associated with his mission, however, required his personal appearance, and thus, his mission, the atoning sacrifice, became the compelling reason for his condescension.<br><br>
                    The Savior’s message, meaning the gospel of Jesus Christ, had been preached before the meridian of time and would yet be preached again. From the lips of Adam the pristine gospel truths had been declared millennia before the Savior’s ministry. Enoch, Noah, and Abraham also preached the gospel in their dispensations. In post-meridian times the Prophet Joseph would restore the gospel in its fulness. . . . Certainly it was a great blessing to have the Savior personally preach his gospel message, but that was not the essential reason for which he came. Others have been his spokesmen, both before and after his mortal advent. . . . The Savior’s message was essential to our salvation, but his personal exposition of it was not.<br><br>
                    The Savior’s ministry included the working of miracles, but Enoch, Moses, Elijah, and others had performed similar wonders before his birth. Peter, Paul, and others would perform like miracles after his ascension. . . . The Savior’s ministry also included the performance of sacred ordinances as well as miracles, but did not his apostles also baptize, give the gift of the Holy Ghost, and perform every other essential gospel ordinance? The Lord’s mortal ministry left us with a wonderful legacy of compassionate deeds, miracles, and priesthood ordinances, but such acts were not confined to his ministry alone.<br><br>
                    While others could preach the Savior’s message and even perform a ministry of miracles and priesthood ordinances, only he could accomplish that divinely appointed mission, namely the redemption of the world. No proxies, no substitutes, no surrogates, not even heaven-sent angels or prophets would or could do. The Atonement required the life and power of a perfect being. He was the sole candidate, the only “name under heaven . . . whereby we must be saved.” This is the prime reason he came to the earth. . . . As important as were his personal message and ministry, they were secondary to his mission—the atoning sacrifice.<br><br>

                    The Savior’s atonement in the garden and on the cross is intimate as well as infinite. Infinite in that it spans the eternities. Intimate in that the Savior felt each person’s pains, sufferings, and sicknesses. Since the Savior, as a God, has the capacity to simultaneously entertain multiple thoughts, perhaps it was not impossible for the mortal Jesus to contemplate each of our names and transgressions in concomitant fashion as the Atonement progressed, without ever sacrificing personal attention for any of us. His suffering need never lose its personal nature. While such suffering had both macro and micro dimensions, the Atonement was ultimately offered for each one of us.</p>

                    If sacrifice for others is the highest manifestation of love, then the Atonement of Jesus Christ is the grandest demonstration of love this world has ever known. The compelling, driving force behind His sacrifice was love, not duty or glory or honor or any other temporal reward. It was love in its purest, deepest, most enduring sense . . . . The Savior’s sacrifice was the noblest gift of all because He who possessed all gave all. His spiritual, emotional, psychological, and life-giving powers were all laid on the altar of sacrifice without restraint. He gave until there was nothing left to give, nothing left to do—until He had fully drawn from that vast reservoir of virtues he possessed in order to work out an infinite sacrifice.</p>

                    The Savior’s Atonement makes the learning process possible by protecting us while we discover through practice what love really is or why wickedness cannot produce happiness. Because of the Atonement, we can learn from our experience without being condemned by it.

                    When we speak of the Atonement, we mean the divine plan whereby fallen, sinful, and finite man is reunited with an exalted, perfect, and infinite God. It is the plan by which estranged parties are brought together, made to be “at one” again. That at-one-ment comes about through the matchless work of God’s Only Begotten Son.<br><br>
                    The Atonement is that divine act of mercy and grace and condescension by which our Father and God opens the door to reunion. In and through Adam, we partake of mortality and death. In and through Christ, our Mediator and Intercessor, we partake of immortality and the abundant life. By means of the Atonement, we are reconciled to the Father. By means of the Atonement, the finite is reconciled to the Infinite, the incomplete to the Complete, the unfinished to the Finished, the imperfect to the Perfect. The Atonement, as an act of grace, demonstrates the love of the Father for his children.</p>

                    The message of the Atonement is this: First, God has prepared a way for us to return to Him. And second, God does not require perfection of us in order for us to gain exaltation. Jesus needed to be perfect. You and I only need to accept and apply His perfection—all the while, seeking to be the best we can. In other words, in Gethsemane and on Galgotha, Jesus willingly became guilty of our sins so that those of us who were willing to love and follow Him might become inheritors of His righteousness.

                    The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can live after we die but that we can live more abundantly. The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can be cleansed and consoled but that we can be transformed. Scriptures make it clear that no unclean thing can dwell with God but no unchanged thing will even want to.<br><br>
                    The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can go home but that—miraculously—we can feel at home there. It Heavenly Father and His Son did not require faith and repentance, then there would be no desire to change. Think of your friends and family members who have chosen to live without faith and without repentance. They don’t want to change. They are not trying to abandon sin and become comfortable with God. Rather, they are trying to abandon God and become comfortable with sin. . . Heaven will not be heaven for those who have not chosen to be heavenly.</p>

                    The Atonement adds three crucial elements to our journey that we could not add by ourselves. First, through the law of mercy and on condition of our repentance, the Atonement allows the Savior to pay for our sins committed along the way, thereby satisfying the law of justice and ensuring our personal forgiveness. Without that cleansing power, we could not return to unity with God, because no unclean thing can enter his presence.<br><br>
                    Second, subject to our doing “all we can do,” the Atonement compensates for the harmful consequences of all our acts of independence, both the consequences we may suffer and the consequences other people suffer through our actions. For example, the resurrection made possible by the Atonement compensates for the physical death all of us will suffer because of Adam and Eve’s decisions in the Garden of Eden. This compensation is available not only to redress the effects of sin but also to redress the effects of bitterness resulting from judgmental choices and undeserved adversity.<br><br>
                    Third, the Atonement somehow releases the forces of grace, through which the Savior empowers and endows us with strength, capacity, hope, and other spiritual gifts we may need, both to continue our journey and to reenter God’s presence endowed with the requisite attributes.</p>

                    Whatever may be the outer limits of the Atonement’s reach, the essential point is that it reaches beyond conscious sin. . .<br><br>
                    The Savior desires to save us from our inadequacies as well as our sins . . .<br><br>
                    The Atonement not only pays for our sins, it heals our wounds—the self-inflicted ones and those inflicted from sources beyond our control.</p>

                    There is another purpose of the Atonement, however, as denoted by the structure of the word. It is to help us become at one with God in the sense that we are like him. This is the exalting quality — to become so perfected in our lives that not only do we live with God, but we become like him. This is the ultimate oneness. Oneness is not only a matter of geography, but of identity. The issue is not just where we live, but what we become. To live with God does not assure us we will be like him. All who live in the celestial kingdom dwell with God, but only those who are exalted become as he is. The objective of the Atonement is not just to cleanse us, but to so transform our lives and our way of thinking and acting that we become like God.</p>

                    In short, had there been no means of bridging the chasm between sinful man and a sinless God, nothing that man could do would make up the loss. Thus there is a need for an atonement, a means of reconciling finite man with an infinite Deity, of repairing the breech between earth and the heavens. Man cannot save himself or rely upon his own merits.

                    He is the Son of God, but he is also God the Son. And if it were not so, he could not save us . . . No one–not the greatest prophet or the mightiest Apostle–has lived a perfect life. All have sinned. All fall short of the glory of God. All are in need of pardoning mercy. Neither death nor sin can be overcome by anything man can devise. Deliverance can come only through the love and forgiveness of one possessed of the power of God, one who traversed life’s paths without committing sin. The reconciliation of fallen, finite men and women to a holy and infinite God is accomplished through the mediation of Jesus Christ, through the implementation of a plan of salvation, through the Atonement. If there had been no atonement or plan of redemption, no amount of good on man’s part could make up for the loss. Jesus Christ is our only hope.</p>

                    The term “Father” as applied to Deity (Jesus Christ) occurs in sacred writ with plainly different meanings.<br><br>
                    1. “Father” as Creator<br><br>
                    Jesus Christ, whom we also know as Jehovah, was the executive of the Father, Elohim, in the work of creation. Jesus Christ is consistently called the Father of heaven and earth.<br><br>
                    2. Jesus Christ the “Father” of Those Who Abide in His Gospel<br><br>
                    A second sense in which Jesus Christ is regarded as the “Father” has reference to the relationship between Him and those who accept His Gospel and thereby become heirs of eternal life. . . . Salvation is attainable only through compliance with the laws and ordinances of the Gospel; and all who are thus saved become sons and daughters unto God in a distinctive sense. By obedience to the Gospel men may become sons of God, both as sons of Jesus Christ, and, through Him, as sons of His Father. . . It is proper to speak of those who accept and abide in the Gospel as Christ’s sons and daughters—and upon this matter the scriptures are explicit and cannot be gainsaid nor denied—it is consistently proper to speak of Jesus Christ as the Father of the righteous, they having become His children and He having been made their Father through the second birth.<br><br>
                    3. Jesus Christ the “Father” By Divine Investiture of Authority<br><br>
                    A third reason for applying the title “Father” to Jesus Christ is found in the fact that in all His dealings with the human family Jesus the Son has represented and yet represents Elohim His Father in power and authority. This is true of Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied state, in the which He was known as Jehovah; also during His embodiment in the flesh; and during His labors as a disembodied spirit in the realm of the dead; and since that period in His resurrected state. Thus the Father places His name upon the Son; and Jesus Christ spoke and ministered in and through the Father’s name; and so far as power, authority and Godship are concerned His words and acts were and are those of the Father. “The Father and the Son,”<br><br>

He would either be a lunatic — — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.

My own experience has led me to conclude that we should do more to make Jesus the man a central focal point in our meetings and lessons. Theological principles become much more meaningful when viewed in the context of a life. People inspire us much more than principles do.</p>

                    Jesus knew that the awful hour of His deepest humiliation had arrived–that from this moment till the utterance of that great cry with which He expired, nothing remained for Him on earth but the torture of physical pain and the poignancy of mental anguish. All that the human frame can tolerate of suffering was to be heaped upon His shrinking body; every misery that cruel and crushing insult can inflict was to weigh heavy on His soul; and in this torment of body and agony of soul even the high and radiant serenity of His divine spirit was to suffer a short but terrible eclipse. Pain in its acutest sting, shame in its most overwhelming brutality, all the burden of sin and mystery of man’s existence in its apostasy and fall—this was what He must now face in all its most inexplicable accumulation.</p>

                    Christ’s agony in the garden is unfathomable by the finite mind, both as to intensity and cause. . . .He struggled and groaned under a burden such as no other being who has lived on earth might even conceive as possible. It was not physical pain, nor mental anguish alone, that caused him to suffer such torture as to produce an extrusion of blood from every pore; but a spiritual agony of soul such as only God was capable of experiencing. . . . In that hour of anguish Christ met and overcame all the horrors that Satan, the prince of this world, could inflict. . . . In some manner, actual and terribly real though to man incomprehensible, the Savior took upon Himself the burden of the sins of mankind from Adam to the end of the world.</p>

                    When the unimaginable burden began to weigh upon Christ, it confirmed His long-held and intellectually clear understanding as to what He must now do. His working through began, and Jesus declared: “Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour.” Then, whether in spiritual soliloquy or by way of instruction to those about Him, He observed, “But for this cause came I unto this hour.”<br><br>
                    Later, in Gethsemane, the suffering Jesus began to be “sore amazed,” or, in the Greek, “awestruck” and “astonished.”<br><br>
                    Imagine, Jehovah, the Creator of this and other worlds, “astonished”! Jesus knew cognitively what He must do, but not experientially. He had never personally known the exquisite and exacting process of an atonement before. Thus, when the agony came in its fulness, it was so much, much worse than even He with his unique intellect had ever imagined! No wonder an angel appeared to strengthen him!<br><br>
                    The cumulative weight of all mortal sins—past, present and future—pressed upon that perfect, sinless, and sensitive soul! All our infirmities and sickness were somehow, too, a part of the awful arithmetic of the atonement. The anguished Jesus not only pled with the Father that the hour and cup might pass from Him, but with this relevant citation. “And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me.”<br><br>
                    Jesus’ request was not theater!<br><br>
                    In this extremity, did He, perchance, hope for a rescuing ram in the thicket? I do not know. His suffering—as it were, enormity multiplied by infinity—evoked His later soul-cry on the cross, and it was a cry of forsakenness.<br><br>
                    Even so, Jesus maintained this sublime submissiveness, as He had in Gethsemane: “Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”<br><br><br>
                    The wondrous and glorious Atonement was the central act in all of human history. It was the hinge on which all else that finally matters turned. But it turned upon Jesus’ spiritual submissiveness!<br><br>

                    It is clear that long before Christ had actually performed the central acts of the Atonement—the suffering in Gethsemane, the death on the cross, the Resurrection—mortals were able to be affected by those acts through theprophetic knowledge that God intended to perform them in the future. What this means is that the mechanics of the mission itself did not need to occur at a certain point in time as a precursor to their effect on people, as some theories of the Atonement would require; Christ’s mission was not to straighten out some metaphysical warp in the universe that Adam’s taking of the fruit had created. The effects of the Atonement were not metaphysical but moral and spiritual: They reach people living at any time and place through their knowledge of the spirit and events of the Atonement. . .<br><br>
                    It is not necessary because of some eternal structure of justice in the universe outside us which demands payment from us for our sins, nor of some similar structure within the nature of God. The Atonement is absolutely necessary because of the nature of intelligences, a nature that is self-existent, not the creation of God, and therefore uniquely impervious to metaphysical coercion. The problem is not that God’s justice must be satisfied (or the universe’s) but that our own sense of justice demands satisfaction. When it creates a barrier to repentance, that barrier must be broken through, and it cannot be broken by metaphysical tinkering with our nature; it can only be broken through by the powerful persuasion of a kind of love which transcends our sense of justice without denying it—the kind of love that Christ was uniquely able to manifest in the Atonement. . .<br><br>
                    We do not repent in order that God will forgive us and atone for our sins, but rather God atones for our sins and begins the process of forgiveness, by extending unconditional love to us, in order that we might repent and thus bring to conclusion the process of forgiveness. And the center of the experience is Christ’s ability to break through the barrier of justice, in those who can freely respond, with the shock of eternal love expressed in Gethsemane. It comes to us only through our deep knowledge of that event and our involvement in the process of sustaining that knowledge in our lives, through the continual reminding of ourselves of the event and our recommitment to the implications of it which occurs in the ordinances of the gospel. The process is a complex one, and ongoing one.

                    The Savior voluntarily let his humanity take precedence over his divinity . . . Not once did he raise the shield of godhood in order to soften the blows. Not once did he don the bulletproof vest of divinity. That he also had godly powers did not make his suffering any less excruciating, any less poignant, or any less real. To the contrary, it is for this very reason that his suffering was more, not less, than his mortal counterparts could experience. He took upon him infinite suffering, but chose to defend with only mortal faculties, with but one exception—his godhood was summoned to hold off unconsciousness and death (i.e., the twin relief mechanisms of man) that would otherwise overpower a mere mortal when he reached his threshold of pain. For the Savior, however, there would be no such relief. His divinity would be called upon, not to immunize him from pain, but to enlarge the receptacle that would hold it. He simply brought a larger cup to hold the bitter drink.</p>

                    In Hebrew the word Geth [gath] means “press”, and semane [shemen] means “oil” or “richness.” Gethsemane therefore means “the press of oil” or the “press of richness.” This refers to the huge presses for olives or grapes that were used to squeeze the oil or wine out of the pulp and that would be appropriately found in an olive grove like Gethsemane. Olives or grapes were put into the presses and squeezed until their juices flowed out of them.<br><br>
                    What an appropriate name for the Garden where Jesus took upon himself the infinite weight of the sins and sorrows of the world and was pressed with that tremendous load until the blood flowed through his skin.

                    The suffering of Jesus Christ in the Garden and on the cross exceeded the combined suffering of all human beings. The suffering of Jesus was not just tough pain and a bad death, it was the most painful of all human experiences and deaths. The suffering of Christ was cumulative; it was in fact infinite. When Christ descended below all things, he crossed the line from finite, that which can be measured, to the infinite. And as his suffering was infinite, so now is his glory infinite, and infinite also is his power to save. . .<br><br>
                    Human nature makes us want to quantify, to measure the atonement of Christ, but his ordeal is off any scale; it is beyond our comprehension. Jesus bore not just the sins of the world, but the sorrows, pains, and sicknesses of the world as well. . .<br><br>
                    All the negative aspects of human existence brought about by the Fall, Jesus Christ absorbed into himself. He experienced vicariously in Gethsemane all the private griefs and heartaches, all the physical pains and handicaps, all the emotional burdens and depressions of the human family.<br><br>
                    God uses no magic wand to simply wave bad things into nonexistence. The sins that he remits, he remits by making them his own and suffering them. The pain and heartaches that he relieves, he relieves by suffering them himself.<br><br>
                    These things can be shared and absorbed, but they cannot be simply wished or waved away. They must be suffered. Thus we owe him not only for our spiritual cleansing from sin, but for our physical, mental, and emotional healings as well, for he has borne these infirmities for us also. All that the Fall put wrong, the Savior in his atonement puts right. It is all part of his infinite sacrifice–of his infinite gift. . . .<br><br>
                    In the Garden and on the cross he said, in essence, “I will suffer this agony; I will sustain it; I will endure this for their sakes and hold on to it until they are saved.” Did his infinite agony tempt him to lay down his life and end his suffering before the price was fully paid? Was his greatest temptation to abandon his weaker brothers and sisters and seek relief from an infinity of pain by dying prematurely? Perhaps. All he had to do was let go, and the pain would stop, but you and I would be lost. And so second by second, hour by hour, he embraced his agony; he could not rest, but he would not die, not until it was finished, not until we were saved with him.<br><br>
                    Thus, when the Victor comes to earth again clothed in power and glory, the angels will declare his infinite and eternal victory: “It is finished; it is finished! The Lamb of God hath overcome and trodden the wine-press alone, even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of the Almighty God.</p>

                    A man incurred substantial debt in order to acquire some coveted goods. The man was warned against incurring the debt, but he felt he could not wait for the luxuries of life. He must have them now. He signed a contract to pay the obligation in what then seemed to be the distant future. The date of payment seemed to be a long time off, but as the days passed the thought of the creditor loomed in the back of the debtor’s mind. Eventually, as it always does, the day of reckoning came. The debtor did not have the means to pay. The creditor threatened foreclosure on the debtor’s goods if payment were not made. The debtor pled for mercy, but to no avail. The creditor demanded justice—stern, unflinching justice, to which he was entitled. The creditor reminded the debtor that he had signed the contract and agreed to the consequences. The debtor responded that he had no means of repayment and begged for forgiveness. The creditor was not swayed. There would be no justice if the debt were forgiven. Just at the moment when all apparent avenues of escape had vanished, a deliverer appeared on the scene.<br><br>
                    “The debtor had a friend. He came to help. He knew the debtor well. He knew him to be shortsighted. He thought him foolish to have gotten himself into such a predicament. Nevertheless, he wanted to help because he loved him. He stepped between them, faced the creditor, and made this offer.<br><br>
                    “‘I will pay the debt if you will free the debtor from his contract so that he may keep his possessions and not go to prison.’<br><br>
                    “And so the creditor agreed.<br><br>
                    "The mediator turned then to the debtor. ‘If I pay your debt, will you accept me as your creditor?’<br><br>
                    “‘Oh yes, yes,’ cried the debtor. ‘You save me from prison and show mercy to me.’<br><br>
                    “‘Then,’ said the benefactor, ‘you will pay the debt to me and I will set the terms. It will not be easy, but it will be possible. I will provide a way. You need not go to prison.’<br><br>
                    “And so it was that the creditor was paid in full. He had been justly dealt with. No contract had been broken.<br><br>
                    “The debtor, in turn, had been extended mercy. Both laws stood fulfilled. Because there was a mediator, justice had claimed its full share, and mercy was fully satisfied.”<br><br>
                    The debtor of this story was not fully forgiven of his debt, but through the intercession of the friend, the terms of payment were made more palatable, and when those terms were satisfied the debt was erased. Likewise, the Savior made it possible for us to pay our debt on more merciful terms through the divine principle of repentance. He is always offering the maximum mercy without ever encroaching on the demands of justice.</p>

Motivated by her father’s promise, she anxiously engaged in chores around the house, carefully saving every penny she earned. One day she returned to him with a jar full of pennies, anxious to now buy her bicycle. Good to his word, Brother Robinson took his elated daughter to the store where she soon found the perfect bike. Then came the moment of truth—the price tag was more than one hundred dollars. Despondent, she counted her sixty-one pennies. She quickly realized that at this rate she would never have enough to buy her dream. Then Brother Robinson lovingly came to the rescue. “I’ll tell you what, dear. Let’s try a different arrangement. You give me everything you’ve got, the whole sixty-one cents, and a hug and a kiss, and this bike is yours.” The bicycle was certainly not totally earned by the young girl, but nonetheless, it was gladly given by a father who recognized she had given her all.</p>

He has helped us all see that there are two essential parts that must be completed in order for the Atonement to be fully effective in our lives. But I think of the Atonement more like this: Jesus already bought the whole bike. The few coins He asks from me are not so much to help pay for the bike, but rather to help me appreciate it, value it, and use it correctly.</p>

                    We are like a power plant on a mighty river. The power plant has no power residing in itself; the potential power rests in the energy of the river. When that source of power flows through the generators of the power plant, power is transferred from the river to the power plant. . . . So it is with faith. The power to achieve justification does not reside in man. Man requires the power of the atonement of Christ flowing into him. If no power is being generated, one does not---indeed, cannot---turn the generators by hand (justification by works); but rather, an effort is made to remove those things which have blocked the power from flowing into the generators (working righteousness as a result of faith). With this background then, one can understand why the scriptures clearly stress that faith includes works; that is, obedience, commitment, and repentance---these are the works of faith that open up the channels so that the power of the atoning sacrifice of Christ can flow into us, redeem us from sin, and bring us back into the presence of God. Disobedience and wickedness dam those channels. (How literal is the word damnation!) The righteous works in themselves do not save us. The atoning power of God saves us. But our righteous works, activated by our faith in the Savior, are the condition for the operation of that power. Thus, each of us has something to say about whether we will seek the gift and power of the Atonement in our lives.</p>

                    A word that occurs frequently in the New Testament, especially in the writings of Paul. The main idea of the word is divine means of help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.<br><br>
                    It is through the grace of the Lord Jesus, made possible by his atoning sacrifice, that mankind will be raised in immortality, every person receiving his body from the grave in a condition of everlasting life. It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals, through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins, receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means. This grace is an enabling (strengthening) power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts.<br><br>
                    Divine grace is needed by every soul in consequence of the fall of Adam and also because of man’s weaknesses and shortcomings. However, grace cannot suffice without total effort on the part of the recipient. Hence the explanation, “It is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.” It is truly the grace of Jesus Christ that makes salvation possible.</p>

If salvation means only erasing our mistakes and sins, then salvation---as wonderful as it is---does not fulfill the Father's aspirations for us. His aim is much higher: He wants His sons and daughters to become like Him. With the gift of God's grace, the path of discipleship does not lead backward; it leads upward.

                    From a doctrinal perspective, God’s grace is his mercy, his love, his condescension toward the children of men. Grace is unmerited favor, unearned divine assistance, goodwill, heavenly benefit, loving kindness.

                    Theologically, the grace of God is his goodwill toward us, his predisposition to act in our best interest even before we can earn or deserve such consideration. Latter-day Saints understand that God’s unconditional grace has been expressed to his children in many ways. For example, God made us his own spirit children in a premortal life. This was a great blessing, yet we did not ask for it, and there was no way we could deserve or earn it or claim a right to it in advance of his making us his children. God did it because he had the ability to do it and because we would be better off if he did. Our birth as his spirit children was an unearned expression of our Father’s goodwill—of unprovoked and indiscriminate love and caring. This is pure grace. . .<br><br>
                    Nevertheless, the term grace is sometimes used in a different sense to describe a quality that is responsive or reactive to human behavior. When spoken of in this sense, God’s favor or grace is not a preexisting given but is something that can be sought after, increased, decreased, or even lost completely by an individual’s own actions. . . . This responsive kind of grace is also the nuance behind most of the scriptural passages in which one individual speaks of finding “grace in the eyes of” another. When the term grace is used with this nuance, as responsive grace, we see how an individual can be said to grow from grace to grace until ultimately coming to a “fulness of grace.”<br><br>
                    Thus we see that some aspects of God’s favor or grace are unilateral and without precondition. These things God has already done for us without any consideration of our individual behavior. They are sheer gifts granted to all human beings alike out of his preexisting love for us. However, other aspects of God’s favor or grace are conditional and may increase, decrease, or even cease altogether in our lives depending upon how we respond to their influence. Nevertheless, in both cases love and grace flow from God to human beings—they originate in him as part of his nature, and he makes the first move. God loves us not because we’re so lovable he can’t help himself—he loves us because his nature is loving, because God is love.</p>

                    Even though there are some conditional aspects of the Atonement that require our adherence to gospel principles for the full realization of eternal blessings, the Book of Mormon makes clear that neither the conditional nor unconditional blessings of the Atonement would be available to mankind except through the grace and goodness of Christ. Obviously the unconditional blessings of the Atonement are unearned, but the conditional ones also are not fully merited. By living faithfully and keeping the commandments of God, we can receive a fuller measure of blessings from Christ, but even these greater blessings are freely given of him and are not technically “earned” by us. In short, good works are necessary for salvation, but they are not sufficient. And God is not obligated to make up the insufficiency.</p>

                    Some gifts coming from the Atonement are universal, infinite, and unconditional. . . . Other aspects of Christ’s atoning gift are conditional. They depend on one’s diligence in keeping God’s commandments. . . Of course neither the unconditional nor the conditional blessings of the Atonement are available except through the grace of Christ. Obviously the unconditional blessings of the Atonement are unearned, but the conditional ones are not fully merited either. By living faithfully and keeping the commandments of God, one can receive additional privileges; but they are still given freely, not technically earned.

                    The grace and faith by which man is saved, are the gifts of God, having been purchased for him not by his own works, but by the blood of Christ. Had not these gifts been purchased for man, all exertions on his part would have been entirely unavailing and fruitless. Whatever course man might have pursued, he could not have atoned for one sin; it required the sacrifice of a sinless and pure Being in order to purchase the gifts of faith, repentance, and salvation for fallen man. Grace, Faith, Repentance, and Salvation, when considered in their origin, are not of man, neither by his works; man did not devise, originate, nor adopt them; superior Beings in Celestial abodes, provided these gifts, and revealed the conditions to man by which he might become a partaker of them. Therefore all boasting on the part of man is excluded. He is saved by a plan which his works did not originate—a plan of heaven, and not of earth.</p>

                    The example of how Jesus gained his grace and power to be glorified encourages disciples to follow him in obedience. Doctrine and Covenants 93 states, “For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fullness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace.” Thus disciples can also grow from grace to grace. Latter-day Saints come to Christ through faith, then repentance and baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, making covenants in the temple, and enduring to the end. Each of these steps is a commitment that leads from grace to grace. Latter-day Saints believe that all people “possess seeds of divinity” and are invited to “cultivate their eternal potential by the grace of God, through the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

                    In mortality, as Jesus responded to the grace (or gifts) of God with grace of his own (that is, with voluntary obedience, service, and sacrifice), he received yet further grace, or gifts, from God. As the mortal Jesus obeyed, served, and emulated his Father, the Father bestowed additional gifts, understanding, and powers upon him. It is critically important to remember that the reciprocal nature of “grace for grace” begins with the grace of God and not with the merit of the individual, and it continues only as long as we respond graciously. The process is not one of merit and reward so much as one of gift and grateful response. As long as we respond to the gifts of God with graciousness of our own, with devoted obedience to God and loving service to others, he will continue to stay ahead of us, to give us additional gracious gifts, until we eventually receive all things. This should not be understood as “earning” grace (an impossibility), for in every case God’s blessings are greater than our performance actually deserves, and we remain indebted to him for his gracious gifts to us. There is a quid pro quo of sorts, but it is one in which God always leaves us in his debt.<br><br>
                    There are levels of grace, or degrees to which one may enjoy the grace of God and act graciously towards others. Thus, from birth on, we move forward in a process of learning and responding to God’s grace, which process can, if we continue in it, lead us to receive a fulness of God’s grace, or gifts. The Savior has shown us how this process works and how one may grow from one level of grace to another higher level, and he invites us to emulate him in doing so.</p>

                    Sometimes we have a tendency to shy away from the word grace and instead to emphasize works (while certain others take the opposite approach)—but in truth, these two concepts go hand in hand. When the lifeguard stretches out a pole to the drowning swimmer, the swimmer must reach out and hold on if he desires to be rescued. Both the lifeguard and the swimmer must fully participate if the swimmer’s life is to be saved. Likewise, works and grace are not opposing doctrines, as is so often portrayed. To the contrary, they are indispensable partners in the process of exaltation.</p>

                    We often think of judgment as a weighing and hope that our best efforts plus Christ’s sacrifice will be enough to tip the scales in our favor. But in reality, both our sins and our righteous deeds are swallowed up in Christ. If we engage with him and participate in the atonement, Christ’s vicarious sacrifice is to stand for us on the scales, where his merits will never be found wanting. This arithmetic of atonement is another way to express the insight of 2 Nephi 31:19, that in salvation we humans must rely “wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.” His merit is perfection. Our job is to give ourselves to him.

That is, by attempting to keep the commandments they can avoid wickedness and make themselves “good’ and “righteous” people who keep most of the rules most of the time. And they don’t need the Savior to do this; all they need is a conscience and some willpower. This kind of righteousness, however, is not celestial in nature but is characteristic of the terrestrial kingdom, for that kingdom will be inhabited by honorable men and women with testimonies of Jesus who will rise in the resurrection of the just.<br><br>
                    Through our own efforts we can make ourselves relatively good or just human beings, and therefore worthy of terrestrial glory, but only Christ can make us perfect! Perfection, that flawless celestial righteousness necessary to dwell in the very presence of God, comes only “through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah.”<br><br>
                    Even if we were to so discipline ourselves that one day we managed to live perfectly, there would still be sins in our past that would render us unworthy of celestial glory. Even if we could in this life eventually live flawlessly, when we died we would still be sinners.<br><br>
                    No one can perfect himself or herself; it is only Christ who can cleanse our past as well as our present and future, who takes just men and women and makes them perfect and celestial by applying his merits, his mercy, and his grace.<br><br>

                    Nothing inspires us to change as profoundly as our understanding of Christ’s love, as expressed though His Atonement. The more deeply we understand it—and feel it—the more deeply we want to change, and the more resolutely we believe we can change. The Atonement of Christ cleanses us of sin, which is part of the Lord’s redeeming grace. But another part of the Atonement, too often overlooked, is empowerment. Grace is strength and power. Through the love and strength of Christ we can do all things. We need that strength every moment of every day, not just to be forgiven and to overcome sins but to resist temptation and to endure. As we trust the Lord and hold onto His outstretched hand, we are infused with power and hope and sweet assurance. We can be forgiven, we can change, and we can progress as we press forward by holding on to Christ, whose mercy is the source and substance of hope. </p>

                    Because we have all “sinned, and come short of the glory of God” and because “there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God,” every one of us is unworthy to return to God’s presence. Even if we were to serve God with our whole souls, it is not enough, for we would still be “unprofitable servants.” We cannot earn our way into heaven; the demands of justice stand as a barrier, which we are powerless to overcome on our own. But all is not lost.<br><br>
                    The grace of God is our great and everlasting hope. . . . The grace of God does not merely restore us to our previous innocent state. If salvation means only erasing our mistakes and sins, then salvation—as wonderful as it is—does not fulfill the Father’s aspirations for us. His aim is much higher: He wants His sons and daughters to become like Him.<br><br>
                    With the gift of God’s grace, the path of discipleship does not lead backward; it leads upward. It leads to heights we can scarcely comprehend! It leads to exaltation in the celestial kingdom of our Heavenly Father, where we, surrounded by our loved ones, receive “of his fulness, and of his glory.” All things are ours, and we are Christ’s. Indeed, all that the Father hath shall be given unto us.</p>

                    There are two different kinds of knowledge. One involves such rational processes as gathering information and memorizing. The other kind of knowledge I would call skill development—learning how to do something like playing the piano or swimming or taking a car engine apart, learning to sing or dance or think. The process of becoming Christlike is a matter of acquiring skills more than a matter of learning facts and figures. And there is something about the nature of developing those divine skills that makes it impossible even for God to teach us those things unless we participate in the process.

                    Grace is the divine help and enabling power that is available throughout the entire perfecting process. Christ stands ready to forgive, but also ready to mentor, strengthen, and empower us.<br><br>
                    These gifts are not a reward waiting for us once we get our acts together, break all our bad habits, and become worthy of His help. They are an unearned and undeserved gift throughout our quest. We must be careful not to see Christ’s grace as somehow supplementing our works or our works as somehow supplementing Christ’s grace, as if we have to meet some sort of minimum height requirement to get into heaven. It is not about height. It is about growth.</p>

                    Too many are giving up on the Church because they are tired of constantly feeling like they are falling short. They have tried in the past, but they continually feel like they are just not good enough. They don’t understand grace. There should never be just two options: perfection or giving up. When learning the piano, are the only options performing at Carnegie Hall or quitting? No. Growth and development take time. Learning takes time.<br><br>
                    When we understand grace, we understand that God is long-suffering, that change is a process, and that repentance is a pattern in our lives. When we understand grace, we understand that the blessings of Christ’s Atonement are continuous and His strength is perfect in our weakness. Jesus doesn’t make up the difference. Jesus makes all the difference. Grace is not about filling gaps. It is about filling us.<br><br>
                    Grace is not a booster engine that kicks in once our fuel supply is exhausted. Rather, it is our constant energy source. It is not the light at the end of the tunnel but the light that moves us through the tunnel. Grace is not achieved somewhere down the road. It is received right here and right now. . . It is not a finishing touch; it is the Finisher’s touch. . . Grace is not the absence of God’s high expectations. Grace is the presence of God’s power.</p>

                    Most of us clearly understand that the Atonement is for sinners. I am not sure, however, that we know and understand that the Atonement is also for saints—for good men and women who are obedient and worthy and conscientious and who are striving to become better and serve more faithfully. I frankly do not think many of us ‘get it’ concerning this enabling and strengthening aspect of the Atonement, and I wonder if we mistakenly believe we must make the journey from good to better and become a saint all by ourselves through sheer grit, willpower, and discipline, and with our obviously limited capacities.</p>

                    Have you been changed by grace? Some are so excited about being saved that maybe they are not thinking enough about what comes next. They are so happy the debt is paid that they may not have considered why the debt existed in the first place. Latter-day Saints know not only what Jesus has saved us from but also what He has saved us for. A life impacted by grace eventually begins to look like Christ’s life. While many Christians view Christ’s suffering as only a huge favor He did for us, Latter-day Saints also recognize it as a huge investment He made in us. Grace isn’t just about being saved. It is also about becoming like the Savior.

                    The doctrine of grace is susceptible to misunderstanding or distortion in several ways. Perhaps the most serious distortion is to argue that since in the covenant relationship Christ makes up what I lack, I don’t need to work as hard anymore. I can relax and let Jesus do everything for me; I can just coast along with a token effort, clinging tenaciously to my favorite sins, and still expect to be “saved by grace. . . .”<br><br>
                    The false doctrine of salvation by grace without commitment or loyalty violates the terms of the gospel covenant by asking Jesus to do for me what I could very well do for myself—but don’t want to. Anyone can pretend to be doing their best and pretend to be justified by faith in Christ and to enjoy the companionship of the Holy Ghost, while in truth they remain obstinately committed to their sins . . .<br><br>
                    A second common distortion of the doctrine of grace, less sinister perhaps than “easy” grace but I think more widespread in the Church, is the view that the Savior extends his grace to us only after we’ve done all we possibly can do. It would follow then that since no one ever really does all they possibly, theoretically could have done, no one can ever really be worthy of grace either. . . . This kind of thinking is merely the old demand for total perfection trying to sneak in the back door of the Church in a gospel disguise, and it mocks the atonement of Christ by insisting that we must perfect and save ourselves before the Savior can save us. . .<br><br>
                    Grace is not merely a decorative touch or a finishing bit of trim to top off our own efforts—it is God’s participation in the process of our salvation from its beginning to its end. Though I must be intimately involved in the process of my salvation, in the long run the success of that venture is utterly dependent upon the grace of Christ.<br><br>

                    Man cannot be saved by grace alone; as the Lord lives, he must keep the commandments; he must work the works of righteousness; he must work out his salvation with fear and trembling before the Lord; he must have faith like the ancients—the faith that brings with it gifts and signs and miracles. . .<br><br>
                    No more heinous doctrine could exist than that which encourages lip service to God but discourages wholehearted obedience and the works attendant to discipleship. Salvation by grace alone and without works as it is taught in large segments of Christendom today, is akin to what Lucifer proposed in preexistence—that he would save all mankind and one soul should not be lost. He would save them without agency, without works, without any act on their part. As with the proposal of Lucifer in the preexistence to save all mankind, so with the doctrine of salvation by grace alone, without works, as it is taught in modern Christendom—both concepts are false. There is no salvation in either of them. They both come from the same source; they are not of God.</p>

                    One of the greatest heresies ever imposed upon the gospel message is the idea that salvation comes by grace alone. Such a doctrine claims and praises Jesus as “Savior” while rejecting him as Lord, as Judge, and as the Just and Holy One. It promises salvation from hell without freedom from sin, faith without faithfulness, and it suggests that intellectual assent supplants wholehearted obedience. It is a doctrine whereby we pledge allegiance without paying our taxes.

                    In an attempt to 'rescue' grace from legalists [those who would turn the gospel into a set of regulations and good works that save us], we have unwittingly delivered it into the hands of libertarians, who insist that grace exempts Christians from any standard of conduct. . . .<br><br>
                    For several centuries we Baptists have enjoyed beating Methodists (and others) over the head with this verse [Ephesians 2:8-9] as proof positive that there is no relationship between good works and salvation. We scoff at those poor souls who attempt to work themselves to the pearly gates. Why would you ever choose a faith that is so difficult? Why not try our brand of works-free Christianity? It is so much easier. . .<br><br>
                    Obviously, something is wrong with this picture! Why is it that those who have received---and actually claim to believe---God's instructions . . . as revealed in the Bible brazenly ignore those same instructions? Two words: Bad grace.</p>

                    Jesus gladly forgave even the most vile of sinners. But he called them to costly discipleship and holy obedience. . . . Cheap grace results when we reduce the gospel to forgiveness of sins and limit salvation to personal fire insurance against hell.</p>

                    We are fighting today for costly grace. . . . Cheap grace means the justification of sin without the justification of the sinner. . . . Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate.<br><br>
                    Costly grace is the treasure hidden in the field. . . . Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the gift which must be asked for, the door at which a man must knock.<br><br>
                    Such grace is costly because it calls us to follow, and it is grace because it calls us to follow Jesus Christ. It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life. It is costly because it condemns sin, and grace because it justifies the sinner. Above all, it is costly because it cost God the life of his Son: “ye were bought at a price,” and what has cost God much cannot be cheap to us.</p>

On our own we cannot earn the kingdom of God—no matter what we do. Unfortunately, there are some within the Church who have become so preoccupied with performing good works that they forget that those works—as good as they may be—are hollow unless they are accompanied by a complete dependence on Christ.

One does not become more and more Christlike through sheer grit and willpower.

It is only by the power of his precious blood that we may be cleansed and sanctified from the taint and tyranny of sin.

                    A man is wondering in a hot and barren waste, and about to die of thirst, when he is caused to look up at the top of the hill where he sees a fountain of water in a restful setting of green grass and trees. His first impulse is to dismiss it as a mirage sent to torture his weary soul. But, being wracked with thirst and fatigue, and doomed to certain destruction anyway, he chooses to believe and pursue this last hope. As he drives his weary flesh to the top of the hill, he begins to see evidence of the reality of his hope; and, renewing his efforts, struggles on to the summit where he wets his parched lips, cools his fevered brow, and restores life to his body as he drinks deeply from the fountain. He is saved!<br><br>
                    What saved him? Was it the climb up the hill? Or was it the water? If he had remained at the foot of the hill either because of disbelief or lack of fortitude, his only means of salvation would have remained inaccessible. On the other hand, if he had climbed to the top and found he had labored in vain, he would have been worse off, if possible. . .<br><br>
                    The climb up the hill represents obedience to the gospel (faith in Christ, repentance, baptism of water, baptism of the Spirit, and endurance to the end); the water is that same eternal drink which Jesus offered the woman at the well. It is the atonement of Christ which is supplied as an act of grace.</p>

                    Salvation is free. Justification is free. Neither of them can be purchased; neither can be earned; neither comes by the Law of Moses, or by good works, or by any power or ability that man has. . . . Salvation is free, freely available, freely to be found. It comes because of his goodness and grace, because of his love, mercy, and condescension toward the children of men. . . .The questions then are: What salvation is free? What salvation comes by the grace of God? With all the emphasis of the rolling thunders of Sinai, we answer: All salvation is free; all comes by the merits and mercy and grace of the Holy Messiah; there is no salvation of any kind, nature, or degree that is not bound to Christ and his atonement.</p>

                    Justice is that which is fair, impartial, right, and proper according to the perfect mind and will of God. Justice is a law of consequences—the equitable, consistent, and deserved consequences that follow either obedience to or violation of divinely established law. Divine justice is inviolable and demands perfect adherence to a perfect standard—God’s standard. Indeed, justice is an attribute of God himself. . . . Justice is so fundamental to God’s nature and ways that without it, “God would cease to be God. . .”<br><br>
                    God’s foreordained plan of salvation operates upon the principle of justice. On the one hand, when individuals obey God’s commandments, they receive blessings guaranteed by the law of justice. . . . On the other hand, individuals who violate any commandment, once they learn of it, are subject to the accompanying penalty for breaking that commandment because God cannot ignore sin, nor “look upon [it] with the least degree of allowance” because of his justice. Every divine law and every command carries a blessing or a penalty: justice affixes a punishment to each violation. Thus, justice is essentially tied to the spiritual law of the harvest. . .<br><br>
                    God cannot magically wave away penalties and punishments. Broken laws must be paid for. Through the Atonement, Christ pays the penalty for sin by his personal suffering. He stands between the sinner and the demands of justice.</p>

                    Justice is the key to all existence. Mercy is the ability to realign with Justice. The key to understanding the plan of salvation is found in these two words. Their importance is without compare . . .<br><br>
                    God is the complete embodiment of perfection (justice). He is one hundred percent just. The justice of God is paramount to the plan of salvation. It is the most important thing in existence. Every law and everything that exist in eternity depend and function upon the principle of justice . . . . If justice is not an absolute, one hundred percent (100%) of the time, all order would cease to exist. . .<br><br>
                    To endure God’s presence and have the ability to live with him means that a person must abide by the demands of justice. The demands of justice are, one hundred (100%) perfection, one hundred (100%) of the time. This is the only way order and existence can be held together. That is why God cannot look upon the least degree of sin. Any degree of sin he allowed would make him less than 100% just.<br><br>
                    If there is no justice there is no God neither the possibility of becoming like God. So for justice to exist its opposite, sin, must be allowed to exist. Mercy is not the opposite of justice. Justice is perfection, the opposite of perfection is sin. Mercy, has no opposite.</p>

                    Jesus gained power by suffering for that which he did not commit. He who was pure and without blemish, paid when he was not required to. He, who was a God, suffered for mankind, going below his station (condescension) when there was no just reason to do so. Is this not the greatest incongruency in eternity? Does not justice, that great eternal force, cry out in indignation?! Does not God, our great and eternal Father, who is the complete embodiment of justice harrow at the sight of this total injustice? Does not his act go against all eternal laws of justice? Indeed, all of eternity cries out in indignation.<br><br>
                    Because of this atonement, God, our Father in Heaven, has obtained the ability to be merciful. Not in himself, for he cannot be, but through his only begotten son, Jesus Christ. This is a very important concept to understand! There was no mercy in the plan of salvation, only justice, until the Christ made the atonement. In order for the plan of salvation to work, it needs to have mercy. God cannot allow man to return to his presence justified. God, now has a way to exchange sin for mercy. . .<br><br>
                    God, who is totally just, needs to bring mercy into the plan of salvation. He cannot do it himself, for to do so he would cease to be God. It is through the atonement that mercy is introduced. . . . This is the correlation between mercy and justice. God can remain just and also gain the power of mercy to save his children. . . . Our Father is justice, so that all existence can endure eternity. Jesus is mercy, so that all mankind can return to God justified. It takes two.</p>

                    Through the process of restoration justice is fully satisfied and the integrity of God preserved. We are rewarded justly for our good or evil. Our thoughts become our actions. Our actions become our habits. Habits become character. Our character is who we are. Who we are is what is restored to us.<br><br>
                    In the restoration justice will recognize mercy. Similar to the ‘angel of death’ that passed by the homes of the Israelites, whohad the lamb’s blood placed over the door, justice will pass by repentant sinners who have placed the blood of the Lamb (mercy) over their sins. This is the great atonement spoken of in the scriptures. This is Jesus Christ, atoning for repentant sinners so the wrath of God (Justice) will pass them by. . .<br><br>
                    If God is the judge then some might think they were judged unfairly; Or that the whole process was prejudiced. With the restoration process all conflict is avoided. We open our souls and know we have received just compensation; Not from God, but from ourselves. We have become what we have become. God is a part of the judgment solely because he is justice. The restoration process is the method in which justice is fulfilled.

                    Standing alongside the concepts of sin and transgression is the law of justice, which implies consistency in reward and punishment. In other words, there would be no justice if one person could violate the law and escape its punishment while another was punished for the same act. The opposite, or positive side, of that idea is that for every keeping of the Lord's law there is a reward. If these punishments and rewards were not consistent throughout the universe and in all of eternity, justice would be violated. Briefly stated, then, the law of justice is that for every violation of law there is a punishment (ultimately suffering and misery), and for every obedience to the law there is a reward (ultimately joy and peace).</p>

                    The Savior could effect deliverance [from sin] for two important reasons. First, he met the demands of the law of justice for himself because he kept the laws of God perfectly. In other words, Christ was justified by his works. He avoided the debt altogether and qualified himself to return to the Father---the only one of all mankind to do so. Secondly, he met the demands of the law for all of the rest of mankind. He himself owed no debt to the law, but he went before it and in essence said: "I am perfect and therefore owe you no suffering. However, I will pay the debt for all mankind. I will undergo suffering that I might pay the price for every transgression and sin ever committed by any man.<br><br>
                    And so, in the Garden of Gethsemane, Christ stood before the law and paid the price in suffering for every sin as though he himself had committed them. Such suffering was beyond the power of any mortal man to endure. We can't understand how he did it, only that he did, and that through Him mercy can be fully extended to each of us without offending the eternal law of Justice. Christ generated sufficient payment to satisfy the debt of every other man. He met the demands of the law for himself through obedience, and for all others through suffering.</p>

                    In this life there are only two lords and two sides. We must choose to belong to the One or the other. If we do not choose the One, we will receive the other by default. There is no middle ground, no third alternative. Life, like a computer, has default settings, conditions that will automatically apply unless we take positive action to avoid them. Thus, if we refuse to make Christ our Lord by taking positive steps to enter into his covenant, then Satan becomes our lord by default. Christ by choice or Satan by default—there are no other options. . . . The choice before us is mercy or justice. Either choice can be accommodated, and either choice is compatible with the nature and plan of God, but, as in the choice between the Lord and Satan, there are no third alternatives. Again, life has default settings, and they are set for justice. We can choose the mercy that is offered through the gospel covenant, but if we refuse that mercy, we will receive justice.</p>

                    The eternal law of justice requires payment for our sins. Yet the eternal law of mercy allows Christ’s suffering to pay justice for our sins—if we repent. As we repent, then, the grace allowed by the law of mercy assures our forgiveness. As we stumble along, we have a perpetual need to repent and learn from our mistakes. This repenting and learning are matched by His perpetual willingness to forgive. Our repentance does not repay Christ—in that sense, we don’t “earn” His grace. However, as a condition of extending grace to us—and to help us grow—He asks us to undertake a process of change or rehabilitation that begins with forsaking our sins. In this context, grace is a two-way street that allows us to interact with him through our repentance.</p>

                    Of course, there is the great dilemma that all of us face. No one—no, not one—is capable of living the commandments fully. No one, save Christ only! From the very hour the commandments were explained to us in the premortal world it was known by all present that we would not be capable of living them to the degree that the law of justice demands—to the degree one must in order to be exalted. It is for this very reason that the Father provided as part of His plan a Savior, a Redeemer, a Messiah. From the foundations of the world the Father chose and foreordained His Only Begotten Son to ransom us all. In so doing, He insured that the impossible would become a reality. We would be exalted! Mercy could not rob justice. But Jesus had within Himself the nature and power to satisfy the demands of justice, thereby making mercy an available gift to all who desire it.</p>

This truth is the very root of Christian doctrine. You may know much about the gospel as it branches out from there, but if you only know the branches and those branches do not touch that root, if they have been cut free from that truth, there will be no life nor substance nor redemption in them.
                    The extension of mercy will not be automatic. It will be through covenant with Christ. It will be on His terms, His generous terms. . . . All mankind can be protected by the law of justice, and at once each of us individually may be extended the redeeming and healing blessing of mercy.</p>

                    Without complying with the principles and the ordinances of the gospel, one is left beyond the reach of the plan of mercy, to rely upon the law of justice, which will require that one suffer for their own sins, even as Jesus suffered.

                    Mercy is not made possible by removing justice but by sustaining it. To the spiritually mature, justice itself is—in the long run—a demonstration of mercy. Heavenly Father’s commandments, demands, standards, and strictness, which are seen by so many as evidence that He is uncompassionate and unkind, are ultimately evidence of His love and caring for us.

                    Reciprocity, the giving and receiving that constitutes any relationship, is also the heart of atonement. Atonement is God’s very mode of being in relationship with us. He is always giving Himself to us unconditionally. He waits upon us to open the doors to our hearts to let Him in. The doors to the heart open only from the inside. He is willing to accept us as justified or guiltless before Him at any time that we are willing to open to Him. It is a gift that He gives to us—indeed, has already given to us. He waits on us to re-turn to Him by accepting Him into our lives and giving ourselves wholly to Him in love. . .<br><br>
                    There is a reason that justification is and must be by grace, as it can be given and received in no other way. The doctrine of justification by grace is the simple recognition that God gives us a gift of unconditional love. He accepts us as guiltless before him the moment we are willing to turn to him—the very moment we are willing to repent. Repentance is just turning to God with an open heart, with a willingness to do whatever it takes to repair the damage to the relationship. By Christ’s Atonement, the moment we give ourselves to him we are justified—we are free of guilt. That is what justification means.

                    Pardon comes by the grace of Him who has satisfied the demands of justice by His own suffering, ‘the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God’. He removes our condemnation without removing the law. We are pardoned and placed in a condition of righteousness with Him. We become, like Him, without sin. We are sustained and protected by the law, by justice. We are, in a word, justified. Thus, we may appropriately speak of one who is justified as pardoned, without sin, or guiltless.<br><br>
                    If justification removes the punishment for past sin, then sanctification removes the stain or effects of sin. . . . This marvelous pardon that relieves us of the punishment that justice would otherwise exact for disobedience and the purifying sanctification that follows are best described as gifts. . . . Given the magnitude of the gift of grace, we would never suppose, even with all the good we could possibly do in this life, that we had earned it. It is just too great.

                    There are two ways justice can be met. One is mercy, the second is hell. Mercy is given through our redeemer and savior Jesus the Christ. What is Jesus saving us from? He is saving us from the other alternative to justice, which is hell. If a person refuses to repent and accept mercy he has no alternative but to pay for this transgression himself. How is payment made at this point? Payment is made in a place of suffering and sacrifices to satisfy the demands of justice. The scriptures term this place, ‘Hell.’ Will this ‘Hell’ have an end? Yes.<br><br>
                    God, being just, only recognizes suffering to the point where justice is satisfied. Once the ends of the law are met no more is required. At the conclusion of payment an individual is released from the place of suffering, Hell, and given his eternal reward or place. These are the degrees of glory spoken of in the scriptures, Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial.

                <p><span>155&nbsp;</span>Christ asks us to show faith in Him, repent, make and keep covenants, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. By complying, we are not paying the demands of justice—not even the smallest part. Instead, we are showing appreciation for what Jesus Christ did by using it to live a life like His. Justice requires immediate perfection or a punishment when we fall short. Because Jesus took that punishment, He can offer us the chance for ultimate perfection and help us reach that goal.<br><br>
                    He can forgive what justice never could, and He can turn to us now with His own set of requirements. . . He can now turn to us and say: “Follow me,” “Keep my commandments.” If we see His requirements as being way too much to ask (“Gosh! None of the other Christians have to pay tithing! None of the other Christians have to go on missions, serve in callings, and do temple work!”), maybe it is because we do not yet see through Christ’s eyes. We have not yet comprehended what He is trying to make of us.

                    Justice requires immediate perfection or a punishment if that perfection is not attained. Because Christ took that punishment for us, He can now provide a different arrangement. He calls for eventual perfection and offers to support us throughout the process. We don’t go to church and partake of the sacrament because we are perfect but because we are willing to be perfected. We don’t go to the temple because we have made it, but because within those walls God and Christ are making us more like Them. They could change us in an instant, but strength so easily attained is not strength at all. This is why, as Christ and Heavenly Father change us from human to divine, They typically do it the same way that a child learns to walk—over time. Time is the medium through which the power of the Atonement is made manifest in our lives.<br><br>
                    Enduring to the end doesn’t just mean to the end of the week, month, year, or even the end of this life. Enduring to the end means enduring to our ultimate end—becoming more like God and Jesus.</p>

                    Jesus Christ, the One who makes all the difference in our salvation, will make up the difference at the time of judgment, at least for those who have come to trust in and rely upon him. But too often I fear the Latter-day Saints think that men and women are expected to do their 85 or 90 percent and leave the remainder, a modest percentage, for Jesus to handle. This is incorrect and misleading, inasmuch as it causes us to overstate our own role in salvation and grossly understate the role of him who has bought us with his blood.</p>

                    Many scriptures make it clear that we will be judged by our works, but those works are not fruitless attempts to pay justice. That bill has already been settled, if we’ll accept it. Our works do not pay part or repay any of it. Rather, they help us resemble and serve the bill payer. To the extent that such a transformation takes place, we are indeed judged by our works.

                    Christ’s arrangement with us is similar to a mom providing music lessons for her child. Mom pays the piano teacher, and because she pays that debt in full, she can turn to her child and ask for practice. Does the child’s practice help pay the piano teacher? No. Does his practice repay Mom for paying the piano teacher? No. Practicing is how the child shows appreciation for Mom’s incredible gift. Practicing is how he takes advantage of the amazing opportunity Mom is providing for him to live his life at a higher level. Mom’s joy is found not in getting repaid but in seeing her gift used—seeing her child improve. And so she continues to call for practice, practice, practice.<br><br>
                    If the child sees Mom’s requirement of practice as being too overbearing (“Gosh, Mom, why do I need to practice? None of the other kids have to practice!

He doesn’t see how much better his life could be if he would choose to live on a higher plane.<br><br>
                    In the same way, because Jesus has paid the price of justice, He can now turn to us and say, “Follow me” “Keep my commandments.” A God who asks nothing of us is making nothing of us.</p>

                    I once wondered if those who refuse to repent but who then satisfy the law of justice by paying for their own sins are then worthy to enter the celestial kingdom. The answer is no. The entrance requirements for celestial life are simply higher than merely satisfying the law of justice. For that reason, paying for our sins will not bear the same fruit as repenting of our sins. Justice is a law of balance and order and it must be satisfied, either through our payment or his. But if we decline the Savior’s invitation to let him carry our sins, and then satisfy justice by ourselves, we will not yet have experienced the complete rehabilitation that can occur through a combination of divine assistance and genuine repentance. Working together, those forces have the power to permanently change our hearts and our lives, preparing us for celestial life.<br><br>
                    By analogy, the criminals who fill our prisons are not necessarily “rehabilitated” when they pay their debt to society by serving a fixed number of years. The payment of that debt may satisfy our sense of retribution, but only a positive process of character change can rehabilitate a lawbreaker.<br><br>
                    The doctrines of mercy and repentance are rehabilitative, not retributive, in nature. The Savior asks for our repentance not merely to compensate him for paying our debt to justice, but also as a way of inducing us to undergo the process of development that will make our nature divine, giving us the capacity to live the celestial law. The “natural man” will remain an enemy to God forever—even after paying for his own sins—unless he also “becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord.

                    If someone falls from an airplane, he will plummet to the ground. The law of gravity will not change to accommodate his dire circumstances. There will be no slowing of the descent or softening of the earth to cushion the fall, however good a fellow he may be. He cannot say just before impact, “Let me take that last step one more time,” No, there is only the automatic application of the law, hard and fast and uncompromising...
                    By way of illustration, God might not be able to rob a man of his agency to jump from a plane (i.e., to prevent him from sinning), but he might be able to put a parachute on the man’s back before he leaps (i.e., provide a means to repent). As the dire consequences of this man’s foolish decision quickly unfold, he still has a chance to land safely: He can pull the rip cord. In such a circumstance no law is violated or circumvented. The law of gravity is still in full force and effect. No justice is robbed; yet the sinner is given power to land safely if he will just pull the rip cord (i.e., repent and rely on the protective life-preserving power of the atonement).

                    If we subject ourselves to the laws of justice, will we receive the same fruit as if we had submitted ourselves to Christ and received the blessings of the laws of mercy? In other words, can we “eat, drink and be merry,” and then at the last minute bear the full weight of justice and receive the same reward as the man who has repented? The answer is no. Paying the price of justice alone neither cleanses the soul nor perfects our character. Yet because of Christ, repentance does both.<br><br>
                    The man who has served his five-year jail term has satisfied the laws of the land; he has paid the debt of justice—but such compliance, such endurance does not, in and of itself, transform a criminal into a saint. All the justice in the universe, administered through all the eons of time, will not produce one single saint. Sainthood, which leads to godhood, requires repentance; repentance requires mercy; and mercy requires the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It always come back to the Atonement.<br><br>
                    The heavy hand of justice does not change or soften or rehabilitate or reform. Unlike repentance, it is not a spiritual catalyst. To the contrary, it is neutral, always neutral.<br><br>
                    The judge with all his mighty sway cannot lower his gavel with purifying power; neither can the iron bars of the most formidable fortress confine with a cleansing catharsis. Justice can be satisfied to the utmost farthing, and yet one can be filthy still. Why? Because the power to cleanse is not bestowed in this manner, but rather by him whose right it is to bestow. Justice is external, repentance is internal. A man’s soul may stoically endure justice, but justice may cause no more change in a human soul than a hammer on cold steel. In contrast, the repentant soul is malleable and flexible. It is molten steel in the forge of the blacksmith, wet clay on the wheel of the potter, a Stradivarius in the grasp of the virtuoso. Repentance is a broken heart and contrite spirit in the hands of the Great Physician. It is the internal desire of man combined with the eternal power of God, so merging in miraculous harmony that it enlarges, endows, and enlightens the human spirit with a godlike nature. Repentance is the divinely chosen process that leads to godhood while satisfying justice each step of the way.<br><br>
                    The law of justice brings about order and stability in the universe. That is good. But the law of repentance does much more; it brings about godhood. Repentance is more than a passive process to “get us even”; it is the affirmative process to improve us, refine us, and ultimately perfect us. Its purpose goes far beyond the satisfaction of justice. It opens the door to the cleansing and perfecting powers of the Atonement. Tad R. Callister, The Infinite Atonement, 224-5.</p>
