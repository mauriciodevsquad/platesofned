                    The third greatest truth in all eternity is that the Holy Spirit of God, a personage of spirit, a member of the Godhead, has power to reveal eternal truth to the heart and soul and mind of man. And that revelation---known first as a testimony, and then known as the general receipt of truth in the spiritual field---that testimony is the great thing that man needs to lead him on a course back to our Father in Heaven.<br><br>
                    Since that is the third greatest truth in all eternity, it follows that the third greatest and third most serious heresy in all eternity is the doctrine that denies that the Holy Spirit of God reveals truth to the human soul, and that denies that there are gifts of the Spirit, that there are miracles and powers and graces and good things that the Lord by his Spirit pours out upon mortal men.

                    The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead and, as the name implies, a personage of Spirit, not possessing a body of flesh and bones. The Holy Ghost has been manifest in every dispensation of the gospel since the beginning, being first made known to Adam. The Holy Ghost is manifested to men on the earth both as the power of the Holy Ghost and as the gift of the Holy Ghost. The power can come upon one before baptism, and is the convincing witness that the gospel is true. It gives one a testimony of Jesus Christ and of his work and the work of his servants upon the earth. The gift can come only after proper and authorized baptism, and is conferred by the laying on of hands. The gift of the Holy Ghost is the right to have, whenever one is worthy, the companionship of the Holy Ghost. More powerful than that which is available before baptism, it acts as a cleansing agent to purify a person and sanctify him from all sin.

                    The witness of the Holy Ghost is central to our entire religious structure: we measure our doctrine, perform our ordinances, judge our worthiness, make our decisions and our covenants, and exercise spiritual gifts, all by the power of the Holy Ghost. The quality of our worship—the very quality of our lives!—depends on our ability to receive and respond to the promptings and whisperings of the Holy Ghost.

                    Men do not get religion until they get the Holy Ghost. Anybody can read about religion and have an intellectual experience by learning what somebody else knew or saw or felt; but religion does not come to the heart of an individual until God speaks to that soul by the power of his Holy Spirit. . .<br><br>
                    Religion is not intellectual alone, although it meets all the standards of perfect intellectuality. Religion is a spiritual thing and people have to get the spiritual experience incident to it; religion comes from God. Men don't ordain it; men can ordain things in the intellectual field, but when you begin dealing with the things of God, no man knoweth the things of God, but by the Spirit of God which is in him.</p>

                    There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him.

                    The Holy Ghost is manifested to men and women on the earth both as the power and as the gift of the Holy Ghost. The power can come upon a person before baptism; it is the convincing witness that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, sincere investigators can acquire a conviction of the truthfulness of the Savior's gospel, of the Book of Mormon, of the reality of the Restoration, and of the prophetic calling of Joseph Smith.

                    The gift of the Holy Ghost is an even greater endowment of light than the power of the Holy Ghost. The gift of the Holy Ghost is received by ordinance. It entitles the recipient to comfort, peace, and guidance beyond what the individual not so endowed is entitled to receive. C.

                    The Holy Spirit may, at God’s discretion, come upon anyone, to any degree, and for any length of time, even if an individual is not yet a confirmed member of the Church. This was the case, for example, with Elizabeth, Zacharias, Simeon, Cornelius, and the young Joseph Smith. In all cases, however, these persons must subsequently receive the laying on of hands to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the power of the Melchizedek Priesthood.</p>

                    Every man can receive a manifestation of the Holy Ghost, even when he is out of the Church, if he is earnestly seeking for the light and for the truth. The Holy Ghost will come and give the man the testimony he is seeking, and then withdraw; and the man does not have a claim upon another visit or constant visits and manifestations from him. He may have the constant guidance of the other Spirit, the Spirit of Christ.

                    This is not to suggest that others do not have faith to be healed, or wisdom or love, for those qualities can be developed to some extent by the Light of Christ, which illuminates every soul, and likewise by those manifestations of the Holy Ghost that may temporarily descend upon an unbaptized person. There are many good and honorable people outside Christ’s church who demonstrate godlike virtues. But faith in its fullest and most enduring measure, that faith that moves mountains, stops the mouths of lions and quenches the violence of fire; that wisdom that duplicates the mind and will of the Lord; and that charity that resembles the pure love of Christ—these and all other divine attributes in their grandest and consummate expression, in their full and unrestricted godlike proportions, come only through the gift of the Holy Ghost. They come to those who have embraced the Savior and his atoning sacrifice and who have so witnessed by baptism and receipt of the Holy Ghost. To reason otherwise would suggest that we, without the gift of the Holy Ghost, could develop a virtue to absolute perfection, and if one such virtue were developed, then arguably all virtues could be attained in like manner. If such a state existed, we could achieve the status of God without the gift of the Holy Ghost—a spiritual impossibility.</p>

                    The Holy Ghost is different from the Light of Christ. He is the third member of the Godhead, a distinct personage of spirit with sacred responsibilities, and one in purpose with the Father and the Son. As members of the Church, we may experience the companionship of the Holy Ghost continually. . .<br><br>
                    The Holy Ghost provides personal revelation to help us make major life decisions about such things as education, missions, careers, marriage, children, where we will live with our families, and so on. In these matters, Heavenly Father expects us to use our agency, study the situation out in our minds according to gospel principles, and bring a decision to Him in prayer. . .<br><br>
                    Each of us may feel the influence of the Holy Ghost differently. His promptings will be felt in different degrees of intensity according to our individual needs and circumstances.

                    The Savior possesses the same mind with the Father, knowing and believing and speaking and doing as though he were the Father. This mind is theirs by the power of the Holy Ghost. That is, the Holy Ghost, who is a personage of spirit (a spirit man!), using the Light of Christ, can give the same mind to all men, whether mortal or immortal. The saints who are true and faithful in all things have, as Paul said, ‘the mind of Christ’ which means also that they have the mind of the Father.</p>

                    These four words—“Receive the Holy Ghost”—are not a passive pronouncement; rather, they constitute a priesthood injunction—an authoritative admonition to act and not simply to be acted upon. The Holy Ghost does not become operative in our lives merely because hands are placed upon our heads and those four important words are spoken. As we receive this ordinance, each of us accepts a sacred and ongoing responsibility to desire, to seek, to work, and to so live that we indeed “receive the Holy Ghost” and its attendant spiritual gifts.</p>

                    The Holy Ghost changes us more thoroughly by renewing the inner man, and by purifying the affections, desires, and thoughts which have so long been habituated in the impure ways of sin. Without the aid of the Holy Ghost, a person who has long been accustomed to love sin, and whose affections and desires have long run with delight in the degraded channel of vice, would have but very little power to change his mind, at once, from its habituated course and walk, and to walk in newness of life.

                    Though his sins may have been cleansed away, yet so great is the force of habit, that he would, without being renewed by the Holy Ghost, be easily overcome, and contaminated again by sin. Hence, it is infinitely important that the affections and desires should be in a measure changed and renewed, so as to cause him to hate that which be before loved, and to love that which he before hated: to renew the mind of man is the work of the Holy Ghost.

                    Often when we teach and speak of the Holy Ghost we tend to emphasize his jobs and not necessarily his role. By definition, a role is the "why" you do it, and a job is the "what" you do to accomplish it. . . . The primary role of the Holy Ghost is to deliver the blessings and powers of the Atonement of Jesus Christ into our daily lives. In fact, when the Holy Ghost is with us and we feel his divine influence, the Atonement of Jesus Christ is operating within us.

                    The sanctifying grace of the Savior Jesus Christ is the source of an entire cluster of blessings and powers. The Atonement not only atones for our sins and compensates for our inadequacies, it is also the source of spiritual endowments that develop and ultimately transform our very nature.<br><br>
                    The agent by which many of these forces enter our lives is the Holy Ghost. . . Some manifestations of this sanctifying process may reflect the Holy Ghost’s mission to act as a comforter, to bear witness of the Father and the Son, and to “teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance.” The gift of the Holy Ghost thus goes well beyond a right to divine inspiration and guidance.

The Holy Ghost reveals truth to every human soul that obeys the law. Obedience qualifies us to know the truth. And then the Holy Ghost sanctifies the human soul, so that we become clean and spotless and eventually are qualified to go where God and Christ are. Bruce R.

These spiritual gifts are distributed among the members of the Church, according to their faithfulness, circumstances, natural abilities, duties, and callings.

                    How does God transmit divine qualities and powers to a mere mortal? . . . The medium for the infusion of godlike powers and enabling traits from a divine being to an ordinary man is the Holy Ghost . . . . Gifts of the Spirit are in fact endowments of godly traits; and thus, as we acquire these gifts, we become partakers of the divine nature. Each of these gifts is a manifestation of some celestial quality. Through the medium of the Holy Ghost, each such gift may be bestowed upon an imperfect being and thus aid him in his pursuit of godhood.

                    How does the Savior’s Atonement work to overcome our weaknesses and ultimately perfect us? Perhaps the underlying reasoning goes something like this: Through the ordinance of baptism we are cleansed because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. As a result of that cleansing, we are eligible to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. With the gift of the Holy Ghost comes the right to receive the gifts of the Spirit. Each of the gifts of the Spirit (e.g., faith, love, wisdom, patience, and so on) represents an attribute of godliness; therefore as we acquire the gifts of the Spirit we acquire the attributes of godliness.

                    The new convert who has accepted the gift of the Holy Ghost with the right spirit will experience not only a cleansing but a feeling that will give him a new heart and make of him a new person. Sometimes this is immediate, and sometimes it happens over a period of time. But always there is a change for the better. For the longer-standing member of the Church who has become preoccupied with the world or in little ways has allowed his religious life to be more procedural than of the spirit, there is something to be rediscovered (and for some, discovered for the first time) with the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost.

                    The doctrine of Sanctification is evidence of how very simple it is to ensure our exaltation. If one but keeps the spirit, he or she will be clean and therefore saved. It is that simple! All other requirements will come naturally. Indeed, the companionship of the Holy Ghost will change our natures in such a way that we will no longer desire to do evil. Instead, he will create in us a desire to do good continually.

                There is what might be called a redemptive dimension of the Light of Christ, a light that we must receive, a "voice" to which we must hearken before we are led to the higher light of the Holy Ghost and are thereby redeemed from our fallen state. Because we have our agency, we can choose to accept or reject this aspect of the light. Whether such redemptive light takes the form of reason or judgment or conscience, we must exercise some degree of faith to enjoy its benefits. Thus, although it is true that this light is available to all of us, it only spiritually enlightens and redeems those of us who hearken to it.

Its inspiration constitutes instinct in animal life, reason in man, vision in the Prophets, and is continually flowing from the Godhead throughout all his creations.

It has no agency, does not act independently, and exists not to act but to be acted upon. It is variously described as light and life and law and truth and power. . . It is the power of God who sitteth upon his throne. It may be that it is also priesthood and faith and omnipotence, for these too are the power of God.

                The dimension of spirit is a dimension of reality subject to precisely the same firmly fixed laws prescribed in all or any part of creation. To be sure, they are as real as any law of physics. Indeed, they are the laws of physics! It appears that the same forces in nature that effect the physical world are manifest in the spiritual as well. Admittedly, the spiritual is an abstraction of reality that extremely distresses those who wish to see it in tangible, three-dimensional form.

                There is not a particle of space that is not under the influence of God through the light of Christ. This light shines from the person of Christ himself and governs and controls all his creations. There is not a particle of existence that is not under his direct control. Not only is Christ the Creator of all that exists, but it is the indwelling light or power of Christ that holds things together in created form from moment to moment. . .<br><br>
                    Since all energy is some form of the light of Christ, and since all living things require energy, then this light of Christ is also the source of life, breath, warmth, and so forth, for all living things. What we normally think of as the physical laws of the universe, the laws by which particles, bodies, and elements are governed and which give stability to existence and make life possible—these are also manifestations of the light of Christ and of his power displayed throughout the universe. . .<br><br>
                    God is a God of order and of power. Therefore everything that he creates is governed by him. He is the ultimate Law of all things and in all things. The power and influence by which he governs is the light of Christ. . . . From time to time one hears the claim that God obeys laws. However, these are not the physical laws of our present world, but spiritual principles like love, justice, mercy, and so forth. God imposes physical laws and interrupts their operations with the application of higher laws entirely at his own will. God does not obey the universe; the universe obeys him.

                    The light of Christ refers to the spiritual power that emanates from God to fill the immensity of space and enlightens every man, woman, and child. . . . The light of Christ is not a person, and it has no body, neither spiritual nor physical. It is a power, the creative power of God, which originates with the Father and has been given in its fulness to the Son.This power fills the universe, imposes laws or principles, and brings order out of chaos. The light of Christ is the divine energy and power of God which is employed to improve and to glorify all things. All energy, power, force, motion, heat, light, intelligence, instinct, truth, priesthood, glory, and so on, are dimensions—more or less pure and refined—of this light or power of Christ . . .<br><br>
                    Each person born into the world receives a portion of the light of Christ. This small portion is sufficient, in most cases, to enlighten our minds and allow the exercise of choice, or agency, for or against the light we have received. Those who love this light and seek it out, who follow their conscience, and who move toward the divine energy they sense in themselves and in the world around them will gradually be given more and more of God’s light. Eventually, in this life or in the next, the faithful will receive more and more light “until the perfect day.”

                The Light of Christ (also called the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of the Lord) is a light, a power, and an influence that proceeds forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space. It is the agency of God’s power and the law by which all things are governed. It is also the agency used by the Holy Ghost to manifest truth and dispense spiritual gifts to many people at one and the same time. For instance, it is as though the Holy Ghost, who is a personage of spirit, was broadcasting all truth throughout the whole universe all the time using the light of Christ as the agency by which the message is delivered. But only those who attune their souls to the Holy Spirit receive the available revelation. It is in this way that the person of the Holy Ghost makes his influence felt in the heart of every righteous person at one and the same time.

                The chief agent employed by God to communicate his will to the universe is the holy spirit, which must not be confused with the Holy Ghost, the personage who is the third member of the Godhead. The holy spirit permeates all the things of the universe, material and spiritual. By the holy spirit the will of God is transmitted. It forms what may be called the great wireless system of communication among the intelligent beings of the universe. The holy spirit vibrates with intelligence; it takes up the word and will of God as given by him or by his personal agents, and transmits the message to the remotest parts of space. By the intelligent domination and infinite extent of the holy spirit, the whole universe is held together and made as one whole. By its means there is no remoteness into which intelligent beings may escape the dominating will of God. By the holy spirit, God is always with us, and “is nearer than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet.”

                    It is for the Light of Christ to attract the attention of those walking in the darkness. It is for the Light of Christ to bring those huddled in the shadows of sin to stand in its warming rays. It is not for the Holy Ghost to “strive” with those laden with sin any more than it is for the curious and spiritually untutored to be invited into holy places and be shown the sacred “hidden treasures” of eternity.<br><br>
                    The baptism of water must precede the baptism of fire. As the ritual of washing must precede the ritual of anointing, so the process of cleansing must proceed the outpouring of the Spirit. It is for the Light of Christ to invite and entice men to do good, while it is for the Holy Ghost to endow with power from on high those who have done good. It is the Light of Christ that prepares men and women to receive the Holy Ghost. Transgression will cause the Holy Spirit to withdraw, leaving the Light of Christ to vie for the attention of the wayward soul. Yet even continual and consistent wickedness can cause the Spirit of Light to withdraw. . .<br><br>
                    The Holy Ghost is more easily offended than the Light of Christ, the companionship of the former being reserved for those who have purified the tabernacle of their soul to receive it. Nevertheless that light which comes from Christ—that light with which all men are born and which has been designated to strive with those in darkness, to bring them into the light—can also be sufficiently offended that it may weary and withdraw.

Everyone everywhere already has the Spirit of Christ, and while the Spirit of the Holy Ghost can visit anyone, the gift of the Holy Ghost is obtained “by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel,” by submitting to “baptism by immersion for the remission of sins;[and the] laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.” It is not automatically present, as the Spirit of Christ is present. This gift must be conferred by one holding authority.

It acts as a moral compass, helping us to know what is morally right and acceptable to God independent of culture or nationality. Without this moral compass we would be relegated to a world of moral relativism. There would be no “spiritual North Star” from which we could get our bearings. This light helps us know the difference between right and wrong. Some may refer to it as our conscience . . .<br><br>
                    In some ways the Light of Christ is like a spiritual candle that is given to all men and women to help them find their way in the dark. God, however, has a much more powerful light that is available to guide us in our journey through life. This latter light might be compared to a brilliant, powerful flashlight that can send its beam brightly through the long corridors of darkness and illuminate the way ahead. It is known as the gift of the Holy Ghost. This gift refines, enlightens, and perfects our judgment so we can better discern between right and wrong.

                    Divine revelation is one of the grandest concepts and principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for without it, man could not know of the things of God and could not be saved with any degree of salvation in the eternities. Continuous revelation from God to his saints, through the Holy Ghost or by other means, such as visions, dreams, or visitations, makes possible daily guidance along true paths and leads the faithful soul to complete and eternal salvation in the celestial kingdom.<br><br>
                    The principle of gaining knowledge by revelation is the principle of salvation. It is the making known of divine truth by communication with the heavens, and consists not only of revelation of the plan of salvation to the Lord’s prophets, but also a confirmation in the hearts of the believers that the revelation to the prophets is true. It also consists of individual guidance for every person who seeks for it and follows the prescribed course of faith, repentance, and obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

                We all know that human judgment and logical thinking will not be enough to get answers to the questions that matter most in life. We need revelation from God. And we will need not just one revelation in a time of stress, but we need a constantly renewed stream. We need not just one flash of light and comfort, but we need the continuing blessing of communication with God.

                Superhuman strength resides in an unseen realm and is filled with knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence beyond anything we have in mortality. If we attune ourselves to it, we can receive inspiration, understanding, impressions, and insight to guide us, comfort us, answer our questions, and dispel our doubt. In short, we can receive divine revelation.

                The spirit of God speaking to the spirit of man has power to import truth with greater effect and understanding than the truth can be imparted by personal contact even with heavenly beings. Through the Holy Ghost the truth is woven into the very fibre and sinews of the body so that it cannot be forgotten. When spirit touches spirit it leaves an indelible impression that is more convincing than the beholding of an angel or can come through the traditional senses.

                When a man has a manifestation from the Holy Ghost, it leaves an indelible impression on his soul, one that is not easily erased. It is Spirit speaking to spirit, and it comes with convincing force. A manifestation of an angel, or even the Son of God himself, would impress the eye and mind, and eventually become dimmed, but the impressions of the Holy Ghost sink deeper into the soul and are more difficult to erase.

                Revelations are not reserved for a limited few or for those called to positions of importance in the church. It is not position in the church that confers spiritual gifts. It is not being a bishop, a stake president, or an apostle that makes revelation and salvation available. These are high and holy callings which open the door to the privilege of great service among men. It is not a call to special office that opens the windows of revelation to a truth seeker. Rather it is personal righteousness; it is keeping the commandments; it is seeking the Lord while he may be found. God is no respecter of persons. He will give revelation to me and to you on the same terms and conditions. I can see what Joseph Smith and Sydney Rigdon saw in the vision of the degrees of glory - and so can you. I can entertain angels and see God. I can receive an out pouring of the gifts of the spirit and so can you.

                    The Spirit speaks words that we feel. These feelings are gentle, a nudge to act, to do something, to say something, to respond in a certain way. If we are casual or complacent in our worship, drawn off and desensitized by worldly pursuits, we find ourselves diminished in our ability to feel . . . . We must be confident in our first promptings. Sometimes we rationalize; we wonder if we are feeling a spiritual impression or if it is just our own thoughts. When we begin to second-guess, even third-guess, our feelings—we are dismissing the Spirit; we are questioning divine counsel. . . .<br><br>
                    First promptings are pure inspiration from heaven. When they confirm or testify to us, we need to recognize them for what they are and never let them slip past. . . .

                It is a great thing to inquire at the hands of God, or to come into His presence; and we feel fearful to approach Him of subjects that are of little or no consequence, to satisfy the queries of individuals, especially about things the knowledge of which men ought to obtain in all sincerity, before God, for themselves, in humility by the prayer of faith. I speak these things not by way of reproach, but by way of instruction.

                As we introduce a truth into our minds and work to personally learn whether or not it might be true, something happens beyond the veil where all truth originates. The Lord “feels after” us in response to our efforts to “feel after” Him (D&amp;C 112:13). Figuratively, the Holy Ghost facilitates a form of “sympathetic vibration” which occurs between the truth within our minds and the truth outside the veil. These “sympathetic vibrations” cause the truth to expand within us. Apostle John Taylor explained it this way: When truth shall touch the cords of your heart they will vibrate; then intelligence shall illuminate your mind, and shed [its] luster in your soul, and you shall begin to understand the things you once knew, but which had gone from you.

                    As we are inside the cloud of fire, the physical sensations will continue, but the feelings will be more moderate than the initial surge. Possibly the word reverberation best describes the effect that exists as the Spirit lingers. Some people call it a tingling sensation. However, it is not a cold chill or a goose bump experience; that would imply a surface skin response. Since the Spirit is literally within us, the feelings are physical, yet internal. It is an internal reverberation caused by the presence of the Spirit.<br><br>
                    As we experience the arrival of the Spirit, our attention is actually only briefly upon the physical sensations. Almost immediately, if not instantly, the Spirit brings to us feelings of joy and peace. These soul-satisfying feelings quickly capture our attention, and we no longer wish to pay attention to physical clues. Instead, our focus is on the immense satisfaction the feelings are providing.

                An honest and sincere truth-seeker may receive a flash of revelation from the Holy Ghost telling him that Jesus is the Christ; that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God; that the Lord has restored the fullness of his everlasting gospel in this day; that the Book of Mormon is the mind and will and voice of God to the world today. That blaze of newly encountered light will be as lightning in a night storm; it will show the path leading to the pure light of day; but unless the one receiving the light walks therein, unless he follows the path, he will remain in darkness and lose the new knowledge he was once ready to receive.

                What about those times when we seek revelation and do not receive it? We do not always receive inspiration or revelation when we request it. Sometimes we are delayed in the receipt of revelation, and sometimes we are left to our own judgment. We cannot force spiritual things. It must be so. Our life’s purpose to obtain experience and to develop faith would be frustrated if our Heavenly Father directed us in every act, even in every important act. We must make decisions and experience the consequences in order to develop self-reliance and faith.<br><br>
                    Even in decisions we think very important, we sometimes receive no answers to our prayers. This does not mean that our prayers have not been heard. It only means that we have prayed about a decision which, for one reason or another, we should make without guidance by revelation.

                A desire to be led by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an understanding that our Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for our personal choices. Personal decision making is one of the sources of the growth we are meant to experience in mortality. Persons who try to shift all decision making to the Lord and plead for revelation in every choice will soon find circumstances where they pray for guidance and don’t receive it. For example, this is likely to occur in those numerous circumstances in which the choices are trivial or where either choice is acceptable. We should study things out in our minds, using the reasoning powers our Creator has placed within us. Then we should pray for guidance and act upon it if we receive it, and upon our best judgment if we do not.

                At various times in our lives, each of us will confront crossroads—circumstances when we must choose either revelation from God or the reason of the world. None will escape. It may come at a time when a loved one is lost, or an unexpected illness befalls us, or there are insufficient funds to pay our tithing, or we feel rejected or lonely, but the conflict will come, not once, but on multiple occasions. . . . If there is a conflict, revelation from God will always trump the reason of man.

It may be that you are not doing anything wrong. It may be that you have not done the right things long enough. Remember, you cannot force spiritual things.

                Such words compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth; you can nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: You must await the growth. Do not be impatient to gain great spiritual knowledge. Let if grow, help it grow; but do not force it, or you will open the way to be misled.
