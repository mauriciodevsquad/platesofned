    No one knows anything about Christ’s work simply by being born a member of the church, and often he knows little about it after years of unmotivated exposure in meetings or classes. He must learn. And learning involves self- investment and effort. The gospel should be studied as carefully as any science. The literature of the church must be acquired and read. Our learning should be increased in our spare time day by day. Then as we put gospel truth to work in daily life, we will never find it wanting. We will be literate in the most important field of knowledge in the universe. </p>

    Each and every member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints bears a personal responsibility to learn and live the truths of the Savior’s restored gospel and to receive by proper authority the ordinances of salvation. We should not expect the Church as an organization to teach or tell us all of the things we need to know and do to become devoted disciples and endure valiantly to the end. . . . The ultimate responsibility for developing spiritual strength and stamina rests upon each and every member of the Church. . . . Spiritual knowledge cannot be given by or borrowed from another person. Shortcuts to the desired destination do not exist. Cramming for the ultimate final examination on the day of judgment is not an option. </p>

    Simple gospel truths carry a spirit all their own, and serious students of the gospel will do well to study those precious morsels over and over again, year in and year out. As they do so, they will discover that the simple teachings of the Lord and his anointed servants begin to take on a profundity that stretches the mind as much as it soothes and settles the heart, filling them with ongoing insights and ever-relevant applications. </p>

    It is a paradox that men will gladly devote time every day for many years to learn science or art; yet will expect to win a knowledge of the gospel, which comprehends all science and arts, through perfunctory glances at books or occasionally listening to sermons. The gospel should be studied more intensively than any school or college subject. They who pass opinion on the gospel without having given it intimate and careful study are not lovers of the truth. </p>

    I sometimes think that one of the best kept secrets of the kingdom is that the scriptures open the door to the receipt of revelation.

    May I suggest based on personal experience, that faith comes and revelations are received as a direct result of scripture study. Those who study, ponder, and pray about the scriptures, seeking to understand their deep and hidden meanings, receive from time to time great outpourings of light and knowledge from the Holy Spirit. . . . However talented men may be in administrative matters, however eloquent they may be in expressing their views; however learned they may be in worldly things - they will be denied the sweet whisperings of the spirit that might have been theirs unless they pay the price of studying, pondering and praying about the scriptures. </p>

    The value of theological knowledge ought not to be underrated; it is doubtful if its importance can be overestimated. . . . Theology deals with Deity, the fountain of knowledge, the source of wisdom . . . with the conditions under which, and the means by which, divine revelation is imparted. . . . Primarily, theology is the science that deals with God and religion. . . .

<br><br>

    Theology and religion, although related, are not identical. One may be deeply versed in theological lore, and yet be lacking in religious and even in moral character. If theology be theory then religion is practice; if theology be precept religion is example. Each should be the complement of the other; theological knowledge should strengthen religious faith and practice. As accepted by the Latter-day Saints, theology comprises the plan of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its entirety.

    I am even more anxiously engaged in the restored gospel than ever because the restored gospel is so engaging. It really does get a grasp on our minds, and there is no end to the exploration that one can make of it. It is, as I said from this pulpit years ago, an “inexhaustible gospel.” To be anxiously engaged really does mean that we are engaged intellectually as well as spiritually.

    A church member sent me a suggestion that someone prepare a book containing all General Authority interpretations of all verses in the scriptures. I replied that I thought this was not a good idea. Latter-day Saints revere our prophets and respect what they have said about the meaning of various scriptures. But what we are seeking to accomplish through the authority and knowledge received in the Restoration is not to magnify the standing of the prophets but to elevate the spirituality of our rank and file members. . . . Scripture-reading can help us receive revelation. . . . We are encouraged to read the scriptures again and again. What a scripture in the Book of Mormon meant to me when I first read it at age 16 is not conclusive upon me as I read it at age 60. With the benefit of my life’s experiences and with my greater familiarity with revelation, I can learn things by reading the scriptures today that were not available to me yesterday. And by reading the scriptures today, I obtain access to what my Heavenly Father would have me know and do today. That is why Latter-day Saints believe in scripture study daily. </p>

    Struggling scripture readers often assume if they read every word, then they will understand a passage. Good scripture readers know reading is more than just saying the words. It is about getting to the principles, knowledge, and insights that the words can represent when they are strung together. However, getting to the ideas buried beneath the words involves hard work that often revolves around the myriad problems readers face when they try to construct meaning. As such, good readers understand that reading scripture is often about solving problems. Good readers do not assume they will read an entire chapter without any trouble. They expect to encounter unfamiliar words, complex sentence structures, abstract concepts, confusing syntax, nuanced character relationships, and a host of other problems as they read. Indeed, good readers count on scripture to give them problems because they understand scripture is rich and complex and that as they read scripture they must constantly solve a variety of problems if they hope to get everything they can out of each chapter and verse.
<br><br>


    Anticipating reading problems prepares good readers to handle them when they arise. Good scripture readers do not get thrown off course or give up when trouble comes. Troubles will always come. But good scripture readers engage the problems skillfully and eagerly—because they have prepared for them. </p>

    I have often used a threefold approach in my study and my teaching that I have found worthwhile: “Know-Identify-Apply (KIA). . . .”
<br><br>


    1. We need to know what the scriptures are saying before we can begin to use them as part of changing our lives. We need to read the scriptures. . . .

<br><br>

    2. As you seek spiritual knowledge search for principles. Carefully separate them from the detail used to explain them. Principles are concentrated truth, packaged for application to a wide variety of circumstances. A true principle makes decisions clear even under the most confusing and compelling circumstances. . . .

<br><br>

    3. When we liken the scriptures to our lives, we do so by applying the principles they teach. We are not trying to apply the people or events or cultural practices or even the text itself—we are applying the principles. This third step is meaningless unless we make it very personal. Unlike a principle, which needs to be universally true, the application of a principle is particularly true for us. . . .
<br><br>


    We should remember the most important component of the approach: having the Spirit with us so we can rely on him to help us learn from the scriptures.

    Joseph Smith could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictate a book like the Book of Mormon, and though I was an active participant in the scenes that transpired, was present during the translation of the plates, and had cognizance of things as they transpired, it is marvelous to me---a marvel and a wonder---as much as to anyone else.

<br><br>

    My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity---I have not the slightest doubt of it . . . . When acting as his scribe, [Joseph] would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this, and for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible. </p>

    He [Joseph] was a religious and straight-forward man. He had to be, for he was illiterate and he could do nothing himself. He had to trust in God. He could not translate unless he was humble and possessed the right feelings toward everyone.

<br><br>

    To illustrate so you can see: one morning when he was getting ready to continue the translation something went wrong about the house and he was put out about it. Something that Emma his wife had done. Oliver and I went upstairs and Joseph came up soon after to continue the translation, but he could not do anything. He could not translate a single syllable. He went downstairs, out into the orchard, and made supplication to the Lord; was gone about an hour. He came back to the house, and asked Emma's forgiveness and then came upstairs where we were, and then the translation went on all right. He could do nothing save he was humble and faithful. </p>

I wish now, standing as it were, in the very sunset of life, and in the fear of God, once and for all to make this public statement: That I have never at any time denied that testimony of the Book of Mormon or any part thereof, which has so long since been published with that book, as one of the Three Witnesses.

After this I commenced its contents by course. I read all day; eating was a burden. I had no desire for food; sleep was a burden when the night came, for I preferred reading to sleep.

If anyone is foolish enough or misled enough to reject 531 pages of heretofore unknown text teeming with literary and Semitic complexity without honestly attempting to account for the origin of those pages—especially without accounting for their powerful witness of Jesus Christ and the profound spiritual impact that witness has had on what is now tens of millions of readers—if that is the case, then such a person, elect or otherwise, has been deceived; and if he or she leaves this Church, it must be done by crawling over or under or around the Book of Mormon to make that exit.

    Just as traditional Christians have no hesitation in viewing the events and teachings of the Old Testament through the lenses of the New Testament, so Latter-day Saints do not hesitate to read the Bible through the lenses of the Book of Mormon, modern scripture, and the words of living apostles and prophets. Supplementation is not the same as contradiction. . .

<br><br>

    In a day when people worldwide have come to doubt the historicity of biblical events, teachings, and values—especially the redemptive role of Jesus the Christ—Latter-day Saint scripture stands as a second witness to their truthfulness and reality. </p>

    The importance of having a firm and sure testimony of the Book of Mormon cannot be overstated. We live in a time of great trouble and wickedness. What will protect us from the sin and evil so prevalent in the world today? I maintain that a strong testimony of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and of His gospel will help see us through to safety. If you are not reading the Book of Mormon each day, please do so. If you will read it prayerfully and with a sincere desire to know the truth, the Holy Ghost will manifest its truth to you. If it is true—and I solemnly testify that it is—then Joseph Smith was a prophet who saw God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.
<br><br>


    Because the Book of Mormon is true, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s Church on the earth, and the holy priesthood of God has been restored for the benefit and blessing of His children.

<br><br>

    If you do not have a firm testimony of these things, do that which is necessary to obtain one. It is essential for you to have your own testimony in these difficult times, for the testimony of others will carry you only so far. However, once obtained, a testimony needs to be kept vital and alive through continued obedience to the commandments of God and through daily prayer and scripture study.

<br><br>

    My dear associates in the work of the Lord, I implore each of us to prayerfully study and ponder the Book of Mormon each day. As we do so, we will be in a position to hear the voice of the Spirit, to resist temptation, to overcome doubt and fear, and to receive heaven’s help in our lives. </p>

    Regular and prayerful scripture study is like putting on the glasses of the Lord. It will influence all you look at, see, and do. . . I suggest that daily prayerful scripture study is the key to being given personal revelation. . . I believe that the habit of prayerfully searching and pondering the scriptures (feasting) is the single most vital spiritual discipline in life. What food is to the body, prayerful scripture study is to the spirit. We physically die without food and we spiritually die without the spirit and the word of God. </p>

    If you wish to go where God is, you must be like God, or possess the principles which God possesses, for if we are not drawing towards God in principle, we are going from Him and drawing towards the devil. As far as we degenerate from God, we descend to the devil and lose knowledge, and without knowledge we cannot be saved. A man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge, for if he does not get knowledge, he will be brought into captivity by some power in the other world. </p>

    For many years I was a teacher of law. A frequent teaching method in that discipline is to concentrate classroom instruction on the difficult questions—the obscure and debatable matters that lie at the fringes of learning. Some law teachers believe that the simple general rules that answer most legal questions are so obvious that students can learn them by independent study. As a result, these teachers devote little time to teaching the basics.



    I believe some of us sometimes do the same thing in gospel teaching. We neglect to teach and testify to some simple, basic truths of paramount importance. This omission permits some members and nonmembers to get wrong ideas about our faith and belief. </p>

Mental laziness is the vice of men, especially with reference to divine things. Men seem to think that because inspiration and revelation are factors in connection with the things of God, therefore the pain and stress of mental effort are not required; that by some means these elements act somewhat as Elijah’s ravens and feed us without effort on our part.  </p>

    We ought to be competent disciples, serious students of the gospel who are able to provide a defense of the faith that is as stimulating to the mind as it is satisfying to the heart. Austin Farrer, a close friend of C.S. Lewis, once remarked that “though argument does not create conviction, the lack of it destroys belief. What seems to be proved may not be embraced; but what no one shows the ability to defend is quickly abandoned. Rational argument does not create belief, but it maintains a climate in which belief may flourish. </p>

    Disciples of Jesus Christ may not know the answers to all questions, but that does not cause us to become absorbed in an intellectual frenzy, in which searching for the answer to the unknown may become our focus to the exclusion of the many glorious truths that we do know. Rather, we are at peace with our testimony of the gospel and understand that it is all right to set aside some unanswered questions for a time because we understand that eventually all things will be revealed and understood.

    A man’s mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or neglected, it must, and will, bring forth. If no useful seeds are put into it, then an abundance of useless weed- seeds will fall therein, and will continue to produce their kind.

<br><br>

    Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts. By pursuing this process, a man sooner or later discovers that he is the master gardener of his soul, the director of his life. He also reveals, within himself, the laws of thought, and understands with ever-increasing accuracy, how the thought-forces and mind-elements operate in the shaping of his character, circumstances, and destiny.

    Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself, the shaper and author of environment. . . .

<br><br>

    Let a man radically alter his thoughts, and he will be astonished at the rapid transformation it will effect in the material conditions of his life. Men imagine that thought can be kept secret, but it cannot; it rapidly crystallizes into habit, and habit solidifies into circumstance. . . .

<br><br>

    A particular train of thought persisted in, be it good or bad, cannot fail to produce its results on the character and circumstances. A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances. </p>

    If we study the scriptures daily as the Lord has asked us to do, somehow he will open the way for us to accomplish the other needed tasks of life. God never puts us at a disadvantage for keeping His commandments; to the contrary, He empowers us to use the remainder of our time more wisely and to be more effective tools in His hands for good.

<br><br>

    This principle is demonstrated by the account of the two axemen who had a contest to determine who could cut down more trees in a day. At sunrise the contest commenced. Every hour the smaller man was seen wandering off into the forest for ten minutes or so. Each time he did so, his opponent smiled, assured he was forging ahead. The larger man never left his post, never stopped cutting, never took a break. When the day ended, the larger man was shocked to learn that his opponent, who had seemingly wasted so much time, had cut many more trees than he. “How did you do it when you took so many breaks?” he asked. The winner replied: “Oh, I was sharpening my axe.” Every time we study the scriptures, we are sharpening our spiritual axe. </p>

    Some among us feel that searching after “the mysteries” is inappropriate, even dangerous, yet the Lord repeatedly issues the invitation to ask. He even gives instructions on the most effective way to ask and to receive; He has in fact revealed ordinances to make asking and receiving more potent. Yes, the pursuit of Truth can be dangerous, but not seeking it results in the yet greater danger of losing one’s exaltation. </p>

    There are so many things in the gospel which are essential for us to know and observe, that we need not bother about the mysteries which have never been revealed. There are many things that we will know when we receive the resurrection and attain to the glories of the kingdom of our Eternal Father, which we cannot understand in this mortal state even if they were revealed to us. The Lord expects us to spend our time preparing for eternity, and he has given us his laws and will revealed to us line on line as we study, all things that are essential for our preparation for salvation in his celestial kingdom. It is the duty of the children of men to seek out fundamental truths and ordinances of the gospel which are made known. </p>

    "Mormonism,” so-called, embraces every principle pertaining to life and salvation, for time and eternity. No matter who has it. If the infidel has got truth it belongs to “Mormonism.” The truth and sound doctrine possessed by the sectarian world, and they have a great deal, all belong to this Church. As for their morality, many of them are, morally, just as good as we are. All that is good, lovely, and praiseworthy belongs to this Church and Kingdom. “Mormonism” includes all truth. There is no truth but what belongs to the Gospel. </p>

    In the gospel sense, intelligence is much more than intellectual knowledge. It is spiritual enlightenment and power. In this context, intelligence, or God’s glory and power, cannot be obtained merely by intellectual pursuits. It must be obtained through faith and righteousness. For this reason the Lord has commanded us to seek intelligence “by study and by faith.” Knowledge can be obtained without any spiritual commitment, merely through study or the scientific method. In contrast, acquiring the intelligence that is God’s glory can be done only through obedience to God’s laws and the principles of the gospel. </p>

    In philosophical terms, “Truth is knowledge of things as they are,” is a declaration that there is an objective reality in the universe. Things are not merely whatever they are perceived to be, or believed to be, or interpreted to be. They are as they really are. Reality is objective rather than subjective. To grow in light, knowledge, intelligence, and glory is to learn the reality of things as they are, rather than as they seem or as they appear to be. This is accomplished through the guidance of the Spirit of truth, which is the power of God and which leads us to true understanding. The light and knowledge conveyed through the Spirit of truth will give us understanding, not only of how things really are now but of what they were in the past and of what they will be in the future. . .
<br><br>


    While it is true that from a human perspective truth often seems relative, it is only our understanding that is relative, incomplete, or that suffers from limited perspective or information. With God, all things are certain. They are as they are and no other way. Through the Spirit of God, those who trust his word can receive intelligence and certainty beyond their own ability, as the light and intelligence of God is added to their own native intelligence. </p>

    In this life, as we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and grow from grace to grace, we receive further light and truth and become holier and holier temples, that is, we become more and more sanctified vessels of divine power and influence.

<br><br>

    The Prophet Joseph Smith and the Restoration scriptures often use such terms as light, truth, spirit, glory, and intelligence interchangeably. When we use our agency to obey God, we are enriched by additional glory or intelligence as a gift from God. This latter kind of intelligence is neither a formal education, nor a quick mind, nor a high I.Q.; rather, it is that light and truth of the spirit that is available to shepherds, fishermen, and farm boys alike. . .

<br><br>

    One definition of true intelligence might be “agency freely choosing truth.” When we demonstrate this kind of intelligence, choosing God and abandoning Satan, we are enlarged by further glory or intelligence from God. As we become one with God, first in the gospel covenant and then further by imitating his thoughts and actions, we move further and further from the devil, ultimately forsaking him altogether. Moreover, as we receive light and truth from God, our power to resist evil and the evil one increases. . .
<br><br>


    Just as true intelligence might be defined as “agency freely choosing truth,” so loss of intelligence comes from agency choosing falsehood. This loss of truth and light can come about from wilful disobedience to God or through deception by human philosophies or the traditions of our fathers. We lose light and truth by our own personal rebellion or by accepting human wisdom in place of the revealed word of God. </p>

    Eternal truths cannot be contravened; things are as they are. Not even God can make what is eternally so into what is not. Truth will operate in its determined course whether human beings accept it or not, whether they believe it or not, or whether they even know of it or not. Similarly, beings possessing truth must also be allowed to operate according to their own choices. . . . This is the grand doctrine of agency. Eternal laws operate as they really are and cannot be contravened. </p>

    The scholar can define the gospel as “all truth,” but the prophet cannot. Prophetic knowledge is not the result of abstract learning. It is not a mastery of theosophic principles or subtle theories. It is something found more naturally in service than in sequestered study. It is more the product of calloused hands than of a furrowed brow. It is more the child of the simple heart than the sire of eloquence of speech. It is something that rests closer to the heart than to the intellect. . . . It is an experiential knowledge of which the revelations speak. Just as we cannot describe colors to a man born blind, so we cannot convey the truths of heaven to those who have not been born of the Spirit. </p>

    Truth is always associated with light because truth can only be acquired through the power or the capacitating force of light. Without the faculty created by light, a fulness of truth could never be gained. . . . Light does the expansion. It enlarges, as it were, the mind. . .<br><br>



    Light (the capacitating power) and enlightenment (or truth) are received by acquisition of celestial element through the Spirit of Christ to those who obey the word. First comes obedience to the word, then light, and finally truth. Thus, all—word, light, truth, spirit—become united. They are inseparably welded together so that a person cannot be touched by one without being touched by all. . .<br><br>



    God is the One who sets the bounds and conditions that make cognition possible. He has determined that man will be glorified only as he receives truth. Man can receive a fulness of truth only as he receives a fullness of light. . . . Intelligence (man) is free to choose or reject light. When it (man) willfully rejects light, it (man) also rejects truth, and condemnation follows. </p>

    The two greatest enemies of light and truth are disobedience and false traditions. Disobedience causes the light to withdraw; and, thus, what truths are left become distorted by dark shadows. “He that repents not,” the Lord said, “from him shall be taken even the light which he has received; for my Spirit shall not always strive with man, said the Lord of Hosts.” False traditions are also antithetical to truth, providing a convenient place to hide from the responsibility to listen, see, and know, thus ostensibly freeing the spiritually lethargic from the responsibility that inevitably follows knowledge of the truth. </p>
