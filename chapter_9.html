    No one knows anything about Christ’s work simply by being born a member of the church, and often he knows little about it after years of unmotivated exposure in meetings or classes. He must learn. And learning involves self- investment and effort. The gospel should be studied as carefully as any science. The literature of the church must be acquired and read. Our learning should be increased in our spare time day by day. Then as we put gospel truth to work in daily life, we will never find it wanting. We will be literate in the most important field of knowledge in the universe. Marion D. Hanks, “Theological Illiterates,” Improvement Era, September 1969, 42.


    2
    Each and every member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints bears a personal responsibility to learn and live the truths of the Savior’s restored gospel and to receive by proper authority the ordinances of salvation. We should not expect the Church as an organization to teach or tell us all of the things we need to know and do to become devoted disciples and endure valiantly to the end. . . . The ultimate responsibility for developing spiritual strength and stamina rests upon each and every member of the Church. . . . Spiritual knowledge cannot be given by or borrowed from another person. Shortcuts to the desired destination do not exist. Cramming for the ultimate final examination on the day of judgment is not an option. David A. Bednar, Increase in Learning, 1,3,16.


    3
    Simple gospel truths carry a spirit all their own, and serious students of the gospel will do well to study those precious morsels over and over again, year in and year out. As they do so, they will discover that the simple teachings of the Lord and his anointed servants begin to take on a profundity that stretches the mind as much as it soothes and settles the heart, filling them with ongoing insights and ever-relevant applications. Robert L. Millet, The Atoning One, 164.


    4
    Preach the first principles of the Gospel---preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You can enlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those you teach. Hyrum Smith, History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6:323.


    5
    It is a paradox that men will gladly devote time every day for many years to learn science or art; yet will expect to win a knowledge of the gospel, which comprehends all science and arts, through perfunctory glances at books or occasionally listening to sermons. The gospel should be studied more intensively than any school or college subject. They who pass opinion on the gospel without having given it intimate and careful study are not lovers of the truth. John A. Witsoe, Evidences and Reconciliations, 16-17.


    6
    The most important knowledge you need to acquire is knowledge of the things of God. Spiritual knowledge, therefore, must have first place in your heart and in your priorities . . . . If you stop learning, you cannot become more knowledgeable, more effective, more useful, more faithful, or more like your Father in Heaven. Kim Clark, “Learning for the Whole Soul,” Ensign, August 2017, 28-29.


    7
    Becoming confident in our knowledge of God does not happen without personal effort. We must become self-reliant gospel learners. Just as we learn how to feed ourselves physically to sustain our bodies, we must learn how to feed ourselves spiritually to sustain our spirits. . . . When we become self-reliant gospel learners, we know how to feed ourselves spiritually and strengthen our relationship with God. David B. Marsh, “Self-Reliance and Gospel Learning,” Ensign, June 2017, 14-15. 


    8
    Faithful study is a requirement, not an elective, for students in God’s classroom. God trusts us to seek and learn and ask and dive deeply into the best books. The scriptures certainly rank as the best of books, but they do not exhaust the category. Patrick Q. Mason, Planted, Belief and Belonging in an Age of Doubt. 86.


    9
    To gain knowledge of great worth requires extraordinary personal effort. This is particularly true when our desire is to obtain spiritual knowledge. Richard G. Scott, "Acquiring Spiritual Knowledge," Ensign, November 1993.


    10
    I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance between myself and deity narrows and spirituality returns. The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 135.


    11
    I challenge you to never forget that the schooling of the spirit is as important, if not more so, than the schooling of the mind. Gordon B. Hinckley, Teaching of Presidents of the Church, 244.


    12
    We study the gospel because of the sanctifying effects it has on our lives: by gospel study we learn the ways of God and can discern whether or not our lives conform to his laws. From such study comes faith. Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrines of the Restoration, 215.


    13
    If you have not heard His voice speaking to you lately, return with new eyes and new ears to the scriptures. They are our spiritual life line.  Robert D. Hales, "Holy Scriptures: The Power of God unto Our Salvation," Ensign, November 2006, 27.


    14
    I sometimes think that one of the best kept secrets of the kingdom is that the scriptures open the door to the receipt of revelation. The prayerful study and pondering of the holy scriptures will do as much or more than any other single thing, to bring that spirit, the spirit of prophecy and the spirit of revelation, into our lives. Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrines of the Restoration, p. 243.


    15
    May I suggest based on personal experience, that faith comes and revelations are received as a direct result of scripture study. Those who study, ponder, and pray about the scriptures, seeking to understand their deep and hidden meanings, receive from time to time great outpourings of light and knowledge from the Holy Spirit. . . . However talented men may be in administrative matters, however eloquent they may be in expressing their views; however learned they may be in worldly things - they will be denied the sweet whisperings of the spirit that might have been theirs unless they pay the price of studying, pondering and praying about the scriptures. Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrines of the Restoration, 236-238. 


    16
    The more we know of gospel truths, the more penetrating, the more convincing, and the more powerful a testimony we can bear; the more we understand of gospel laws, the more perfectly are we able to administer the programs of the kingdom and the ordinances of salvation; the more fully we understand gospel principles, the more perfectly we are able to counsel and instruct others—particularly in our own families—and thereby earn the rewards of eternal life. Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrines of the Restoration, 215-216.


    17
    The value of theological knowledge ought not to be underrated; it is doubtful if its importance can be overestimated. . . . Theology deals with Deity, the fountain of knowledge, the source of wisdom . . . with the conditions under which, and the means by which, divine revelation is imparted. . . . Primarily, theology is the science that deals with God and religion. . . .



    Theology and religion, although related, are not identical. One may be deeply versed in theological lore, and yet be lacking in religious and even in moral character. If theology be theory then religion is practice; if theology be precept religion is example. Each should be the complement of the other; theological knowledge should strengthen religious faith and practice. As accepted by the Latter-day Saints, theology comprises the plan of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its entirety.

    James E. Talmage, Articles of Faith, 4-6.


    18
    I am even more anxiously engaged in the restored gospel than ever because the restored gospel is so engaging. It really does get a grasp on our minds, and there is no end to the exploration that one can make of it. It is, as I said from this pulpit years ago, an “inexhaustible gospel.” To be anxiously engaged really does mean that we are engaged intellectually as well as spiritually.

    Neal A. Maxwell, “Sharing Insights From My Life,” BYU Devotional, January 12, 1999.


    19
    We use scriptures to “spiritualize” our consciousness. Dwelling on scriptural quotations or statements of truth helps to spiritualize thought. The more truth that we read and hear, the more active is truth in our consciousness.

    Joel Goldsmith, Practicing the Presence, 20.


    20
    What you do with scripture, including the neglect thereof, is a wonderful way for the Lord to get a measure of your soul.

    Joseph Fielding McConkie, Religious Educator, 2009, 79. 


    21
    The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who can’t read them. Mark Twain.



    What we bring to the scriptures in large part determines how much we take from them.

    Truman G. Madsen, The Presidents of the Church, 169.

    What we bring to the scriptures in large part determines how much we take from them.

    Truman G. Madsen, The Presidents of the Church, 169.


    23
    If we are not reading the scriptures daily, our testimonies are growing thinner.

    Harold B. Lee, Regional Representative Seminar, December 12, 1970.


    24
    The more we are familiar with the scriptures, the closer we become to the mind and will of the Lord. It will be easier for us to allow the truths of eternity to rest on our minds. Ezra Taft Benson, Come unto Christ, 20.


    25
    A simple layman armed with scripture is to be believed above a pope or a cardinal without it. Martin Luther 


    26
    The best commentary on the scriptures is the scriptures. Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrines of the Restoration, 216.


    27
    A church member sent me a suggestion that someone prepare a book containing all General Authority interpretations of all verses in the scriptures. I replied that I thought this was not a good idea. Latter-day Saints revere our prophets and respect what they have said about the meaning of various scriptures. But what we are seeking to accomplish through the authority and knowledge received in the Restoration is not to magnify the standing of the prophets but to elevate the spirituality of our rank and file members. . . . Scripture-reading can help us receive revelation. . . . We are encouraged to read the scriptures again and again. What a scripture in the Book of Mormon meant to me when I first read it at age 16 is not conclusive upon me as I read it at age 60. With the benefit of my life’s experiences and with my greater familiarity with revelation, I can learn things by reading the scriptures today that were not available to me yesterday. And by reading the scriptures today, I obtain access to what my Heavenly Father would have me know and do today. That is why Latter-day Saints believe in scripture study daily. Dallin H. Oaks, Scripture Reading and Revelation, January 29, 1993.


    28
    Struggling scripture readers often assume if they read every word, then they will understand a passage. Good scripture readers know reading is more than just saying the words. It is about getting to the principles, knowledge, and insights that the words can represent when they are strung together. However, getting to the ideas buried beneath the words involves hard work that often revolves around the myriad problems readers face when they try to construct meaning. As such, good readers understand that reading scripture is often about solving problems. Good readers do not assume they will read an entire chapter without any trouble. They expect to encounter unfamiliar words, complex sentence structures, abstract concepts, confusing syntax, nuanced character relationships, and a host of other problems as they read. Indeed, good readers count on scripture to give them problems because they understand scripture is rich and complex and that as they read scripture they must constantly solve a variety of problems if they hope to get everything they can out of each chapter and verse.



    Anticipating reading problems prepares good readers to handle them when they arise. Good scripture readers do not get thrown off course or give up when trouble comes. Troubles will always come. But good scripture readers engage the problems skillfully and eagerly—because they have prepared for them. Eric D. Rackley, Developing Scripture Literacy: What Good Scripture Readers Know and Do, Religious Educator, Vol. 17:3, 16-17.


    29
    I have often used a threefold approach in my study and my teaching that I have found worthwhile: “Know-Identify-Apply (KIA). . . .”



    1. We need to know what the scriptures are saying before we can begin to use them as part of changing our lives. We need to read the scriptures. . . .



    2. As you seek spiritual knowledge search for principles. Carefully separate them from the detail used to explain them. Principles are concentrated truth, packaged for application to a wide variety of circumstances. A true principle makes decisions clear even under the most confusing and compelling circumstances. . . .



    3. When we liken the scriptures to our lives, we do so by applying the principles they teach. We are not trying to apply the people or events or cultural practices or even the text itself—we are applying the principles. This third step is meaningless unless we make it very personal. Unlike a principle, which needs to be universally true, the application of a principle is particularly true for us. . . .



    We should remember the most important component of the approach: having the Spirit with us so we can rely on him to help us learn from the scriptures. Charles Swift, “For Our Profit and Learning,” Religious Educator, Vol. 16:2, 163-171. 


    Book of Mormon

    30
    I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book. Joseph Smith, History of the Church, 4:461.


    31
    Joseph Smith could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictate a book like the Book of Mormon, and though I was an active participant in the scenes that transpired, was present during the translation of the plates, and had cognizance of things as they transpired, it is marvelous to me---a marvel and a wonder---as much as to anyone else.



    My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity---I have not the slightest doubt of it . . . . When acting as his scribe, [Joseph] would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this, and for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible. Emma Smith, Last Testimony of Sister Emma, Saints Herald, October 1, 1879, 26:290.


    32
    He [Joseph] was a religious and straight-forward man. He had to be, for he was illiterate and he could do nothing himself. He had to trust in God. He could not translate unless he was humble and possessed the right feelings toward everyone.



    To illustrate so you can see: one morning when he was getting ready to continue the translation something went wrong about the house and he was put out about it. Something that Emma his wife had done. Oliver and I went upstairs and Joseph came up soon after to continue the translation, but he could not do anything. He could not translate a single syllable. He went downstairs, out into the orchard, and made supplication to the Lord; was gone about an hour. He came back to the house, and asked Emma's forgiveness and then came upstairs where we were, and then the translation went on all right. He could do nothing save he was humble and faithful. David Whitmer, Comprehensive History of the Church, 1:131.


    33
    Unto all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People, unto whom these presents shall come: . . . I wish now, standing as it were, in the very sunset of life, and in the fear of God, once and for all to make this public statement: That I have never at any time denied that testimony of the Book of Mormon or any part thereof, which has so long since been published with that book, as one of the Three Witnesses. Those who know me best well know that I have always adhered to that testimony. And that no man may be misled or doubt my present views in regard to the same, I do again affirm the truth of all my statements as then made and published. . . . My sincere desire is that the world may be benefited by this plain and simple statement of the truth. And all the honor to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen! David Whitmer, Richmond, Missouri, Conservator, March 25, 1881.


    34
    What is truly remarkable---really miraculous---is the fact that this massive translation [Book of Mormon] was completed in sixty working days by an uneducated but highly imaginative zealot steeped in the religious fervor of his age. As a writer, I find that feat absolutely incredible. Sixty days! Two months to produce a work running over six hundred pages and of such complexity and density. Unbelievable. Robert V. Remini, a non-LDS Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Illinois at Chicago, "Biolographical Reflections on the American Joseph Smith," in The Worlds of Joseph Smith, ed. John W. Welch, 27.


    35
    I opened it (Book of Mormon) with eagerness, and read its title page. I then read the testimony of several witnesses in relation to the manner of its being found and translated. After this I commenced its contents by course. I read all day; eating was a burden. I had no desire for food; sleep was a burden when the night came, for I preferred reading to sleep. As I read, the spirit of the Lord was upon me, and I knew and comprehended that the book was true, as plainly and manifestly as a man comprehends and knows that he exists. Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, 22. 


    36
    This book must be either true of false. If true, it is one of the most important messages ever sent from God to man. If false, it is one of the most cunning, wicked, bold, deep-laid impositions ever palmed upon the world, calculated to deceive and ruin millions who will receive it as the word of God. Orson Pratt, speaking of the Book of Mormon.


    37
    Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none. TPJS, 71.


    38
    No member of the church can stand approved in the presence of God who has not seriously and carefully read the

    Book of Mormon. Joseph Fielding Smith - CR Oct 1961.


    39
    The measure of one’s spirituality can be tested by his acceptance or rejection of the Book of Mormon. Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrines of the Restoration, 217.


    40
    Careful study of the Book of Mormon is of eternal value. Rather than wasting valuable time reading so much emptydrivel, we should be studying things of the eternities. Hugh Nibley, The Prophetic Book of Mormon, 85.


    41
    Every Latter-Day Saint should make the study of this book a lifetime pursuit. Ezra Taft Benson, “The Book of Mormon is the Word of God,” Ensign, May 1975.


    42
    Not all truths are of equal value, nor are all scriptures of the same worth. What better way to nourish the spirit than to frequently feast from the book which the prophet Joseph said would get a man “nearer to God by abiding by its precept, than by any other book?” Ezra Taft Benson, A Witness and a Warning, 10.


    43
    Great revelations—literally—await those who will let the Book of Mormon speak for itself about its central message, Christ’s Atonement, “according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of God.” Bruce C. Hafen, The Broken Heart, 26.


    44
    Members of the church everywhere should know the Book of Mormon better than any other book. Not only should we know what history and faith promoting stories it contains, but we should understand its teachings...I have noted within the church the difference in discernment, in insight, conviction and spirit between those who know and live the Book of Mormon and those who do not. That book is a great sifter. Ezra Taft Benson, New Era, May 1975.


    45
    There is a power in the Book of Mormon which will begin to flow into your lives the moment you begin a serious study of the book. You will find greater power to resist temptation. You will find the power to avoid deception. You will find the power to stay on the strait and narrow path. The scriptures are called “the words of life,” and nowhere is that more true than it is of the Book of Mormon. When you begin to hunger and thirst after those words, you will find life in greater and greater abundance. Ezra Taft Benson, “The Book of Mormon—Keystone of Our Religion,” Ensign, Nov 1986, 4.


    46
    We learn by asking and searching. . . . When you are ready, please open your heart to the Book of Mormon, again, for the first time. Please pray with real intent, again, for the first time. Trust that early or faint memory. Let it enlarge your faith. Gerrit W. Gong, “Always Remember Him,” Ensign, May 2016, 110.


    47
    Combined with the Spirit of the Lord, the Book of Mormon is the greatest single tool which God has given us to convert the world. If we are to have the harvest of souls that He expects, then we must use the instrument which God has designed for that task - the Book of Mormon. Ezra Taft Benson, A Witness and a Warning, 11. 


    48
    The Book of Mormon is the volume that God has ordained in this day to get you in tune with the Spirit and to get you to feel that this work is divine. . . . You can be in tune with the Lord; you can be in harmony with the Spirit more and better by a study of the Book of Mormon than anything that God has ever given in our day. The Book of Mormon is the portion of his word which he has preserved and segregated and set out by itself to introduce the gospel and to bring testimony into the hearts of the people. Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrines of the Restoration, 43-44.


    49
    Men can get nearer to the Lord, can have more of the spirit of conversion and conformity in their hearts, can have stronger testimonies, and can gain a better understanding of the doctrines of salvation through the Book of Mormon than they can through the Bible...there will be more people saved in the kingdom of God - ten thousand times over - because of the Book of Mormon than there will be because of the Bible. Bruce R. McConkie, BYU Devotional, 1978.


    50
    I testify that one cannot come to full faith in this latter-day work—and thereby find the fullest measure of peace and comfort in these, our times—until he or she embraces the divinity of the Book of Mormon and the Lord Jesus Christ, of whom it testifies. If anyone is foolish enough or misled enough to reject 531 pages of heretofore unknown text teeming with literary and Semitic complexity without honestly attempting to account for the origin of those pages—especially without accounting for their powerful witness of Jesus Christ and the profound spiritual impact that witness has had on what is now tens of millions of readers—if that is the case, then such a person, elect or otherwise, has been deceived; and if he or she leaves this Church, it must be done by crawling over or under or around the Book of Mormon to make that exit. Jeffrey R. Holland, “Safety for the Soul,” Ensign, November 2009. 


    51
    All the scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, will remain in the realm of faith. Science will not be able to prove or disprove holy writ. However, enough plausible evidence will come forth to prevent scoffers from having a field day, but not enough to remove the requirement of faith. Believers must be patient during such unfolding. Neal A. Maxwell, Plain and Precious Things, 4.


    52
    Just as traditional Christians have no hesitation in viewing the events and teachings of the Old Testament through the lenses of the New Testament, so Latter-day Saints do not hesitate to read the Bible through the lenses of the Book of Mormon, modern scripture, and the words of living apostles and prophets. Supplementation is not the same as contradiction. . .



    In a day when people worldwide have come to doubt the historicity of biblical events, teachings, and values—especially the redemptive role of Jesus the Christ—Latter-day Saint scripture stands as a second witness to their truthfulness and reality. Robert L. Millet, The Vision of Mormonism, 193-194.


    53
    The importance of having a firm and sure testimony of the Book of Mormon cannot be overstated. We live in a time of great trouble and wickedness. What will protect us from the sin and evil so prevalent in the world today? I maintain that a strong testimony of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and of His gospel will help see us through to safety. If you are not reading the Book of Mormon each day, please do so. If you will read it prayerfully and with a sincere desire to know the truth, the Holy Ghost will manifest its truth to you. If it is true—and I solemnly testify that it is—then Joseph Smith was a prophet who saw God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.



    Because the Book of Mormon is true, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s Church on the earth, and the holy priesthood of God has been restored for the benefit and blessing of His children.



    If you do not have a firm testimony of these things, do that which is necessary to obtain one. It is essential for you to have your own testimony in these difficult times, for the testimony of others will carry you only so far. However, once obtained, a testimony needs to be kept vital and alive through continued obedience to the commandments of God and through daily prayer and scripture study.



    My dear associates in the work of the Lord, I implore each of us to prayerfully study and ponder the Book of Mormon each day. As we do so, we will be in a position to hear the voice of the Spirit, to resist temptation, to overcome doubt and fear, and to receive heaven’s help in our lives. Thomas S. Monson, “The Power of the Book of Mormon,” Ensign, May 2017, 86.


    Knowledge

    54
    Apply yourselves diligently to study, that your minds maybe stored with all necessary information. TPJS, 43. 


    55
    Learning by faith requires spiritual, mental, and physical exertion not just passive reception. David A. Bednar, "Seek Learning by Faith," Religious Educator 7, no 3 (2006):5


    56
    God hath not revealed anything to Joseph, but what He will make known unto the Twelve, and even the least Saint may know all things as fast as he is able to bear them. TPJS, 149. 


    57
    I want you all to know God, to be familiar with him. . . . When we know how to come to him, God begins to unfold the heavens to us and tell us all about it. Joseph Smith, Times and Seasons, Vol 5, no. 15, 613, 615.


    58
    The things of God are of deep import; and time and experience; and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only find them out. Joseph Smith, History of the Church, 3: 295.


    59
    The great plan of salvation is a theme which ought to occupy our strict attention, and be regarded as one of heaven’s best gifts to mankind. TPJS, 68. 


    60
    The best kept secret in the Church is the gospel. Chauncey Riddle, Emeritus BYU Religion/Philosophy Professor.


    61
    It is one thing to know the gospel is true and another thing to know the gospel. Selected Writings of Robert L. Millet, 360.


    62
    I am impressed with the testimony of a man who can stand and say he knows the gospel is true. But what I would like to ask is ‘But, sir, do you know the gospel? . . . Mere testimony can be gained with but perfunctory knowledge of the Church and its teachings. . . . But to retain a testimony, to be of service in building the Lord’s kingdom, requires a serious study of the gospel and knowing what it is. Hugh B. Brown, Using the Scriptures, 124.


    63
    When we want to speak to God, we pray. And when we want Him to speak to us, we search the scriptures; for His words are spoken through His prophets. He will then teach us as we listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Robert D. Hales, “Holy Scriptures: The Power of God unto Our Salvation,” Ensign, October 2006, 26-27.


    64
    In speaking of these wondrous things I shall use my own words, though you may think they are the words of scripture, words spoken by other Apostles and prophets. True it is they were first proclaimed by others, but they are now mine, for the Holy Spirit of God has borne witness to me that they are true, and it is now as though the Lord had revealed them to me in the first instance. I have thereby heard his voice and know his word. Bruce R. McConkie, “The Purifying Power of Gethsemane,” Ensign, May 1985. 


    65
    Specialize in the fundamentals, and find delight in the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Serious students of scripture will gradually discover a second simplicity, a simplicity beyond complexity. Robert L. Millet, Living in the Eleventh Hour, 108.


    66
    The more we treasure the scriptures and the words of the prophets and apply them, the better we will be able to recognize when we are drifting—even if by only a few degrees. Dieter F. Utchdorf, “A Teacher of God’s Children,” (Address to CES religious educators, January 28, 2011). 


    67
    Our hearts cannot be drawn out to a God we do not know, and the scriptures and the words of living prophets help us know Him. As we know Him better, we love Him more. Henry B. Eyring, “Prayer,” Ensign, November 2001, 15. 


    68
    Our only hope for a life in Christ is to keep searching diligently in the Light of Christ, integrating more and more of it, so as to be able to bear yet more. . . . The eternal spirit has an appetite for spiritual things. . . . The mind must be fixed on God and nourished from the hidden springs. M. Catherine Thomas, Light in the Wilderness, viii.


    69
    Regular and prayerful scripture study is like putting on the glasses of the Lord. It will influence all you look at, see, and do. . . I suggest that daily prayerful scripture study is the key to being given personal revelation. . . I believe that the habit of prayerfully searching and pondering the scriptures (feasting) is the single most vital spiritual discipline in life. What food is to the body, prayerful scripture study is to the spirit. We physically die without food and we spiritually die without the spirit and the word of God. Stephen R. Covey, Divine Center, 187-188.


    70
    If you wish to go where God is, you must be like God, or possess the principles which God possesses, for if we are not drawing towards God in principle, we are going from Him and drawing towards the devil. As far as we degenerate from God, we descend to the devil and lose knowledge, and without knowledge we cannot be saved. A man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge, for if he does not get knowledge, he will be brought into captivity by some power in the other world. TPJS, 217.


    71
    We are duty-bound to learn all that God has revealed about himself and his everlasting gospel. If we are to gain eternal life we must come to know the Great God and his Only Begotten, whom he sent into the world. And this probationary estate is the appointed time to begin to know God, and to learn his laws, and thereby to start the process of becoming like him. If we do not so begin we shall never receive the promised reward. Bruce R. McConkie, “The Mystery of Godliness,” BYU Fireside January 1985.


    72
    In our worship there are two elements: One is the spiritual communion arising from our own meditation; the other, instruction from others . . . . Of the two, the more profitable . . . is meditation. . . . Meditation is one of the most secret, most sacred doors through which we pass into the presence of the Lord. David O. McKay, CR, April 1967, 85.


    73
    For many years I was a teacher of law. A frequent teaching method in that discipline is to concentrate classroom instruction on the difficult questions—the obscure and debatable matters that lie at the fringes of learning. Some law teachers believe that the simple general rules that answer most legal questions are so obvious that students can learn them by independent study. As a result, these teachers devote little time to teaching the basics.



    I believe some of us sometimes do the same thing in gospel teaching. We neglect to teach and testify to some simple, basic truths of paramount importance. This omission permits some members and nonmembers to get wrong ideas about our faith and belief. Dallin H. Oaks, “What Think Ye of Christ?,” Ensign, Nov. 1988, 75-76. 


    74
    As a General Authority, it is my responsibility to preach general principles. When I do, I don’t try to define all the exceptions. . . . I only teach the general rules. Whether an exception applies to you is your responsibility. You must work that out individually between you and the Lord. Dallin H. Oaks, CES Fireside, Oakland, Ca., May 1, 2005.


    75
    If a man learns nothing more than to eat, drink and sleep, and does not comprehend any of the designs of God, the beast comprehends the same things. It eats, drinks, sleeps, and knows nothing more about God; yet it knows as much as we, unless we are able to comprehend by the inspiration of Almighty God. If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves. Joseph Smith, King Follett Discourse, TPJS, 343.


    76
    A hierarchy of importance exists among the things you and I can learn. Indeed, all information and knowledge are not equally important. . . . Many facts are helpful or merely interesting to know. Some knowledge is useful to learn and apply. But gospel truths are essential for us to understand and live if we are to become what our Heavenly Father yearns for us to become. . . . Of the many types of knowledge that can be acquired, spiritual knowledge is the most important—both in mortality and eternity. David A. Bednar, Increase in Learning, 63-64.


    77
    It requires striving–intellectual and spiritual–to comprehend the things of God– even the revealed things of God. . . Mental laziness is the vice of men, especially with reference to divine things. Men seem to think that because inspiration and revelation are factors in connection with the things of God, therefore the pain and stress of mental effort are not required; that by some means these elements act somewhat as Elijah’s ravens and feed us without effort on our part.  The Essential B.H. Roberts, 260-261.


    78
    We ought to be competent disciples, serious students of the gospel who are able to provide a defense of the faith that is as stimulating to the mind as it is satisfying to the heart. Austin Farrer, a close friend of C.S. Lewis, once remarked that “though argument does not create conviction, the lack of it destroys belief. What seems to be proved may not be embraced; but what no one shows the ability to defend is quickly abandoned. Rational argument does not create belief, but it maintains a climate in which belief may flourish. Robert L. Millet, No Weapon Shall Prosper, ix.


    79
    There is so much to learn about the great eternal verities which shape our destiny that it seems a shame to turn our attention everlastingly to the minutiae and insignificant things. . . . There is such a thing as virtually useless knowledge, the acquisition of which won’t make one iota of difference to the destiny of the kingdom or the salvation of its subjects. Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrines of the Restoration, 232. 


    80
    We, the Latter-day Saints, take the liberty of believing more than our Christian brethren: we not only believe . . . the Bible, but . . . the whole of the plan of salvation that Jesus has given to us. Do we differ from others who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ? No, only in believing more. Brigham Young, J.D., 13:56.


    81
    A man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge, for if he does not get knowledge, he will be brought into captivity by some power in the other world. As far as we degenerate from God, we descend to the devil and lose knowledge, and without knowledge we cannot be saved, and while our hearts are filled with evil, and we are studying evil, there is no room in our hearts for good, or studying good. TPJS, 217.


    82
    The principle of knowledge is the principle of salvation. This principle can be comprehended by the faithful and diligent, and everyone that does not obtain knowledge sufficient to be saved will be condemned. The principle of knowledge is given us through the knowledge of Jesus Christ. . . . It is not wisdom that we should have all knowledge at once presented before us; but that we should have a little at a time; then we can comprehend it. TPJS, 297.


    83
    The principle of knowledge is the principle of salvation. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to advance in knowledge. Ehat and Cook, The Words of Joseph Smith, 200.


    84
    Knowledge is Revelation. Hear all ye brethren, this grand Key: Knowledge is the power of God unto Salvation.

    Ehat and Cook, The Words of Joseph Smith, 207.


    85
    Knowledge saves a man; and in the world of spirits no man can be exalted but by knowledge. TPJS, 357.


    86
    Knowledge does away with darkness, suspense and doubt; for these cannot exist where knowledge is. . . . In knowledge there is power. TPJS, 287-88.


    87
    Do you think that people will obey the truth because it is true, unless they love it? No, they will not. Thus knowing gospel truths and doctrines is profoundly important, but we must also come to love them. When we love them, they will move us and help our desires and outward works to become more holy. Neal A. Maxwell, “According to the Desire of our Heart,” Ensign, November 1996, 22.


    88
    Knowledge is not power unless it is sustained by . . . character. Karl G. Maeser, Called to Teach, xxxi.


    89
    Knowledge carefully recorded is knowledge available in time of need. Spiritually sensitive information should be kept in a sacred place that communicates to the Lord how you treasure it. This practice enhances the likelihood of your receiving further light. Richard G. Scott, “Acquiring Spiritual Knowledge,” Ensign, November 1993, 86.


    90
    No one, no matter how much they love us, can win the war against evil for us. We alone, each of us individually, must gain sufficient knowledge and strength of self, to totally overcome the powers of darkness in the eternal battle for our souls. . . . Satan knows this, so he tries to prevent us from gaining sufficient self mastery and the knowledge we need to triumph over him by side tracking us with the cares of the world, or by interesting us in gaining knowledge about things which, though interesting, have no real consequence upon our eternal standing. Further Light & Knowledge, 84-85.


    91
    Reading the experience of others, or the revelation given to them, can never give us a comprehensive view of our condition and true relation to God. Knowledge of these things can only be obtained by experience through the ordinances of God set forth for that purpose. Could you gaze into heaven five minutes, you would know more than you would by reading all that ever was written on the subject. TPJS, 324.


    92
    I could explain a hundred fold more than I ever have of the glories of the kingdoms manifested to me in the vision, were I permitted, and were the people prepared to receive them. The Lord deals with this people as a tender parent with a child, communicating light and intelligence and the knowledge of his ways as they can bear it. Joseph Smith, History of the Church, 5:402.


    93
    We should not get into that old sectarian notion, that we have no right to know anything about this, that or the other, and that we must not pry into this, that or the other. That is an old sectarian notion, which we have fought against all the day long, and we do not want it to creep into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is the privilege of its members to let their minds expand, and to ponder upon the things of God, and to enquire of him, and by and by, when we have prepared ourselves by getting all the knowledge we possibly can from that which is written, God will give us more. Orson Pratt, J.D., 16:354.


    94
    One thing I have learned through the years is not to become preoccupied with unanswered questions, not to obsess over them, not to allow them to make me spiritually dysfunctional . . . . I have learned to place many items on the shelf for the time being to allow time and study and seasoning and maturity either to prepare me for an answer down the road or to prepare me not to receive an answer, perhaps even in this life. Robert L. Millet, Holding Fast: Dealing With Doubt in the Latter Days, 75-76. 


    95
    Disciples of Jesus Christ may not know the answers to all questions, but that does not cause us to become absorbed in an intellectual frenzy, in which searching for the answer to the unknown may become our focus to the exclusion of the many glorious truths that we do know. Rather, we are at peace with our testimony of the gospel and understand that it is all right to set aside some unanswered questions for a time because we understand that eventually all things will be revealed and understood.

    Holzapfel & Strathearn, He Will Give You Rest, 70.


    96
    Why not leave a matter which in no way concerns us alone. Joseph Fielding Smith, Answers to Gospel Questions, 2:145.


    97
    When we go through the veil we shall know much more about these matters than we now do. Brigham Young


    98
    Religion, to be effective, must appeal to the understanding as well as to the emotions of man.

    B.H. Roberts, The Truth, The Way, The LIfe, 2.


    99
    We may not prevent the birds from flying over our heads but we can prevent them from building nests in our hair. We will be, when our life’s labor is complete, the product of our thoughts. George Albert Smith, The Presidents of the Church, 214.


    100
    A man’s mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or neglected, it must, and will, bring forth. If no useful seeds are put into it, then an abundance of useless weed- seeds will fall therein, and will continue to produce their kind.



    Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts. By pursuing this process, a man sooner or later discovers that he is the master gardener of his soul, the director of his life. He also reveals, within himself, the laws of thought, and understands with ever-increasing accuracy, how the thought-forces and mind-elements operate in the shaping of his character, circumstances, and destiny.

    James Allen, As a Man Thinketh, 6-7. 


    101
    Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself, the shaper and author of environment. . . .



    Let a man radically alter his thoughts, and he will be astonished at the rapid transformation it will effect in the material conditions of his life. Men imagine that thought can be kept secret, but it cannot; it rapidly crystallizes into habit, and habit solidifies into circumstance. . . .



    A particular train of thought persisted in, be it good or bad, cannot fail to produce its results on the character and circumstances. A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances. James Allen, As a Man Thinketh, 10-11, 19-21.


    102
    If we study the scriptures daily as the Lord has asked us to do, somehow he will open the way for us to accomplish the other needed tasks of life. God never puts us at a disadvantage for keeping His commandments; to the contrary, He empowers us to use the remainder of our time more wisely and to be more effective tools in His hands for good.



    This principle is demonstrated by the account of the two axemen who had a contest to determine who could cut down more trees in a day. At sunrise the contest commenced. Every hour the smaller man was seen wandering off into the forest for ten minutes or so. Each time he did so, his opponent smiled, assured he was forging ahead. The larger man never left his post, never stopped cutting, never took a break. When the day ended, the larger man was shocked to learn that his opponent, who had seemingly wasted so much time, had cut many more trees than he. “How did you do it when you took so many breaks?” he asked. The winner replied: “Oh, I was sharpening my axe.” Every time we study the scriptures, we are sharpening our spiritual axe. Tad R. Callister, The Blueprint of Christ’s Church, 300-301.


    103
    There is so much information that I always feel we need to be cautious and wise to ever keep uppermost in our minds the simple doctrine and gospel of Christ. Simply stated, it is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance of sin, baptism by immersion for the remission of sin, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. M. Russell Ballard, “Let Us Think Straight,” Religious Educator, Vol. 15:2, 1. 


    Doctrine

    104
    Doctrine informs, it inspires, it empowers. Robert L. Millet, The Vision of Mormonism, 227.


    105
    We need to not only know the doctrine but, whenever possible, the underlying rationale so we can explain the doctrine in a clear and concise and powerful way. Tad R. Callister, The Blueprint of Christ’s Church, Preface, x. 


    106
    It is true intelligence for a man to take a subject that is mysterious and great in itself, and to unfold and simplify it so that a child can understand it. John Taylor, Gospel Kingdom, 270.


    107
    In relation to the power over the minds of mankind which I hold, I would say, it is in consequence of the power of truth in the doctrines which I have been an instrument in the hands of God of presenting unto them. Joseph Smith, History of the Church, 6:273.


    108
    This is good doctrine. It tastes good. You say honey is sweet and so do I. I can also taste the spirit and principles of eternal life, and so can you. I know it is good and that when I tell you of these words of eternal life that are given to me by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and the revelations of Jesus Christ, you are bound to receive them as sweet. Joseph Smith, "The King Follett Discourse," BYU Studies, 18:2:204.


    109
    True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior. That is why we stress so forcefully the study of the doctrines of the gospel. Boyd K. Packer, “Little Children,” Ensign, November 1986, 20.


    110
    Spiritual wrestling leverages the strength of true doctrine to overpower our weaknesses, our wavering faith, and our lack of knowledge. Spiritual wrestlers are seekers. They are men and women of faith who want to understand more than they presently do and who are serious about increasing the light and knowledge in their lives. Sheri Dew, Worth the Wrestle, 22.


    111
    Some things are. They just are. Neither judicial decisions nor popular opinion changes absolute truth. Truth never changes. Charles, W. Penrose, C.R., October 1911, 48.


    112
    Deeds do matter as well as doctrines, but the doctrines can move us to do the deeds, and the Spirit can help us to understand the doctrines as well as prompt us to do the deeds. Neal A. Maxwell, That My Family Should Partake, 87.


    113
    Some church members know just enough about the doctrines to converse superficially on them, but their scant knowledge about the deep doctrines is inadequate for deep discipleship. Thus uniformed about the deep doctrines, they make no deep change in their lives. Neal A. Maxwell, Men and Women of Christ, 2.


    114
    A doctrine should not be ignored simply because it is difficult. Indeed, deep inside the hardest doctrines are some of the pearls of greatest price. Neal A. Maxwell, "A More Determined Discipleship," Ensign, February 1979, 69.


    115
    The doctrines of Jesus Christ by themselves are dangerous. Any principle of the gospel, isolated, spun off, and practiced in solitude goes wild and goes mad. It is only the orthodoxy of the gospel that keeps it together, because these are powerful principles that need each other. Just as the people of the Church need each other, the doctrines of the Church need each other. Neal A. Maxwell, “The Gospel Gives Answers to Life’s Problems,” Address to Religious Educators, Summer of 1970.


    116
    When weary legs falter and detours and roadside allurements entice, the fundamental doctrines will summon from deep within us fresh determination. Extraordinary truths can move us to extraordinary accomplishments. Neal A. Maxwell, All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience, 4. 


    117
    There is more revelation to come relative to all things. The last word has not been spoken on any subject. Streams of living water shall yet flow from the Eternal Spring who is the source of all truth. There are more things we do not know about the doctrines of salvation than there are things we do know. Bruce R. McConkie, “A New Commandment: Save Thyself and Thy Kindred!” Ensign, August 1976.


    Mysteries

    118
    A mystery is a spiritual truth that was once hidden but now is revealed, and that without special revelation would have remained unknown. LDS Bible Dictionary, 736.


    119
    A mystery is an unseen Truth, the substance of which lies beyond Man’s senses and rational faculties, and therefore must be revealed by God in order for it to be known by Man; Man cannot find it out with the limited resources he has unless God uncovers it for him. M. Catherine Thomas, Light in the Wilderness, 276. 


    120
    The mysteries are those matters that can only be known and understood by the power of the Holy Ghost.

    Harold B. Lee, Ye Are the Light of the World, 211.


    121
    The Savior has the words of eternal life. Nothing else can profit us. I advise all to go on to perfection, and search deeper and deeper into the mysteries of Godliness. A man can do nothing for himself unless God direct him in the right way. Joseph Smith, History of the Church, 6:363.


    122
    Men who are destitute of the influence of the Holy Ghost, or the Spirit of God, cannot understand the things of God; they may read them, but to them they are shrouded in darkness. Brigham Young, J.D., 9:330.


    123
    Some among us feel that searching after “the mysteries” is inappropriate, even dangerous, yet the Lord repeatedly issues the invitation to ask. He even gives instructions on the most effective way to ask and to receive; He has in fact revealed ordinances to make asking and receiving more potent. Yes, the pursuit of Truth can be dangerous, but not seeking it results in the yet greater danger of losing one’s exaltation. M. Catherine Thomas, Light in the Wilderness, 274.


    124
    There are so many things in the gospel which are essential for us to know and observe, that we need not bother about the mysteries which have never been revealed. There are many things that we will know when we receive the resurrection and attain to the glories of the kingdom of our Eternal Father, which we cannot understand in this mortal state even if they were revealed to us. The Lord expects us to spend our time preparing for eternity, and he has given us his laws and will revealed to us line on line as we study, all things that are essential for our preparation for salvation in his celestial kingdom. It is the duty of the children of men to seek out fundamental truths and ordinances of the gospel which are made known. Joseph Fielding Smith, Answers to Gospel Questions, Vol. 4:127.


    Light & Truth

    125
    Some truths matter more than others. Spencer W. Kimball, “Acquiring Spiritual Literacy,” (BYU Devotional, September 9, 1980).


    126
    Not all truth is of the same value or importance. Some truths are greater than others.

    Joseph Fielding Smith, CR, April 1955, 51.


    127
    Not all knowledge has the same worth, nor are all truths equally valuable. The truths upon which our eternal salvation rests are the most crucial truths that we must learn. Ezra Taft Benson, Come Unto Christ, 32.


    128
    All knowledge is not of equal significance. There is no democracy of facts! They are not of equal importance. Something might be factual, but not important. For instance, today I wear a dark blue suit. That is true, but it is unimportant. As, more and more, we brush against truth, we sense that it has a hierarchy of importance. Some truths are salvationally significant and others are not. Neal A. Maxwell, “The Inexhaustible Gospel,” Ensign, April 1993.


    129
    The best way to obtain truth and wisdom is not to ask it from books, but to go to God in prayer, and obtain divine teaching. TPJS, 191.


    130
    In this church you don’t have to believe anything that isn’t true.  Henry J. Eyring, Mormon Scientist, 4.


    131
    If we have the truth, it cannot be harmed by investigation. If we have not the truth, it ought to be harmed. J. Reuben Clark, as recorded by D. Michael Quinn in J. Reuben Clark: The Church Years, 24.


    132
    It is never proper to teach any person more than his spiritual capacity qualifies him to assimilate. Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, 393.


    133
    Truth begets truth, and error begets error. Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrines of the Restoration, 6.


    134
    Truth does not contradict Truth. If the Truths of science are true and the Truths of religion are true, then they will harmonize.

    David W. Allan, It's About Time, xiii.


    135
    It is as important for us to know what we do not know as it is to know what we know. Robert L. Millet, The Atoning One, 15.


    136
    Truth and untruth, travel together side by side. Light and darkness both offer themselves to the seeker after truth, one to bless, the other to destroy mankind. Whenever a man sets out to seek truth, he will for a time be overtaken by evil. No seeker after truth is, therefore, ever free from temptation, from evil power. John A. Widstoe, "The significance of the First Vision," Logan Institute, December 8, 1946.


    137
    If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed. Marcus Aurelius


    138
    The truth knocks on the door and you say, ‘Go away, I’m looking for the truth,’ and so it goes away. Robert Pirsig


    139
    Men occasionally stumble over truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened.

    Winston S. Churchill


    140
    Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain’t goin’ away. Elvis Presley 


    141
    A man hears what he wants to hear, and disregards the rest. Simon & Garfunkel, The Boxer.


    142
    One of the grand fundamental principles of ‘Mormonism’ is to receive truth, let it come from whence it may. TPJS, 313.


    143
    Have the Presbyterians any truth? Yes. Have the Baptists, Methodists, etc., any truth? Yes. They all have a little truth mixed with error. We should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up, or we shall not come out true ‘Mormons.’ TPJS, 316.


    144
    Our religion takes within its wide embrace not only things of heaven, but also things of earth. It circumscribes all art, science, and literature. Brigham Young, J.D., 7:271.


    145
    I never told you I was perfect, but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught.

    Ehat and Cook, The Words of Joseph Smith, 369.


    146
    I will not seek to compel any man to believe as I do, only by the force of reasoning, for truth will cut its own way. TPJS, 313. 


    147
    The truth is not always beautiful, nor beautiful words the truth. Lao Tzu


    148
    The truth will set you free, but first it will make you miserable. Jamie Buckingham


    149
    Truth demands sacrifices, but truth is worth any sacrifice. Brad Wilcox, The Continuous Conversion, 153.


    150
    All is not gold that shines. . . yet, by proving contraries, truth is made manifest.  

    Joseph Smith, History of the Church, 6: 428.


    151
    Truth carries its own influence and recommends itself. Ehat and Cook, The Words of Joseph Smith, 237.


    152
    Truth is the sanctifier of those who love it and are guided by it, while falsehood corrupts and destroys.

    Heber C. Kimball. J.D., 209.


    153
    A principle is an enduring truth, a law, a rule you can adopt to guide you in making decisions. Generally principles are not spelled out in detail. That leaves you free to find your way with an enduring truth, a principle, as your anchor.  Boyd K. Packer, “The Word of Wisdom: The Principle and the Promise,” Ensign, May 1996, 17.

    Honesty, integrity, and truth are eternal principles that significantly shape our experience in morality and help determine our eternal destiny. For a disciple of Christ, honesty is at the very heart of spirituality. Neal A. Andersen, “The Divine Standard of Honesty,” Ensign, August 2017, 40.

    "Mormonism,” so-called, embraces every principle pertaining to life and salvation, for time and eternity. No matter who has it. If the infidel has got truth it belongs to “Mormonism.” The truth and sound doctrine possessed by the sectarian world, and they have a great deal, all belong to this Church. As for their morality, many of them are, morally, just as good as we are. All that is good, lovely, and praiseworthy belongs to this Church and Kingdom. “Mormonism” includes all truth. There is no truth but what belongs to the Gospel. Brigham Young, J.D., 11:375.


    156
    Keep all the truth and all the good that you have. Do not abandon any sound or proper principle. Do not forsake any standard of the past which is good, righteous, and true. Every truth found in every church in all the world we believe . . . The more truth we have, the greater is our joy here and now; the more truth we receive, the greater is our reward in eternity. Russell M. Nelson, “Teach Us Tolerance and Love,” Ensign, May 1994, 70.


    157
    I was going to say I am not a Universalist, but I am, and I am a Presbyterian, and a Roman Catholic, and a Methodist, in short, I believe in every true principle that is imbibed by any person or sect, and reject the false. If there is any truth in heaven, earth, or hell, I want to embrace it, I care not what shape it comes in to me, who brings it, or who believes it, whether it is popular or unpopular.

    John Taylor, J.D., 1:155.

    In the gospel sense, intelligence is much more than intellectual knowledge. It is spiritual enlightenment and power. In this context, intelligence, or God’s glory and power, cannot be obtained merely by intellectual pursuits. It must be obtained through faith and righteousness. For this reason the Lord has commanded us to seek intelligence “by study and by faith.” Knowledge can be obtained without any spiritual commitment, merely through study or the scientific method. In contrast, acquiring the intelligence that is God’s glory can be done only through obedience to God’s laws and the principles of the gospel. Brent L. Top, LDS Beliefs, 324. 


    159
    In philosophical terms, “Truth is knowledge of things as they are,” is a declaration that there is an objective reality in the universe. Things are not merely whatever they are perceived to be, or believed to be, or interpreted to be. They are as they really are. Reality is objective rather than subjective. To grow in light, knowledge, intelligence, and glory is to learn the reality of things as they are, rather than as they seem or as they appear to be. This is accomplished through the guidance of the Spirit of truth, which is the power of God and which leads us to true understanding. The light and knowledge conveyed through the Spirit of truth will give us understanding, not only of how things really are now but of what they were in the past and of what they will be in the future. . .



    While it is true that from a human perspective truth often seems relative, it is only our understanding that is relative, incomplete, or that suffers from limited perspective or information. With God, all things are certain. They are as they are and no other way. Through the Spirit of God, those who trust his word can receive intelligence and certainty beyond their own ability, as the light and intelligence of God is added to their own native intelligence. Robinson & Garrett, A Commentary on the Doctrine and Covenants, 3:186-187.

    In this life, as we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and grow from grace to grace, we receive further light and truth and become holier and holier temples, that is, we become more and more sanctified vessels of divine power and influence.



    The Prophet Joseph Smith and the Restoration scriptures often use such terms as light, truth, spirit, glory, and intelligence interchangeably. When we use our agency to obey God, we are enriched by additional glory or intelligence as a gift from God. This latter kind of intelligence is neither a formal education, nor a quick mind, nor a high I.Q.; rather, it is that light and truth of the spirit that is available to shepherds, fishermen, and farm boys alike. . .



    One definition of true intelligence might be “agency freely choosing truth.” When we demonstrate this kind of intelligence, choosing God and abandoning Satan, we are enlarged by further glory or intelligence from God. As we become one with God, first in the gospel covenant and then further by imitating his thoughts and actions, we move further and further from the devil, ultimately forsaking him altogether. Moreover, as we receive light and truth from God, our power to resist evil and the evil one increases. . .



    Just as true intelligence might be defined as “agency freely choosing truth,” so loss of intelligence comes from agency choosing falsehood. This loss of truth and light can come about from wilful disobedience to God or through deception by human philosophies or the traditions of our fathers. We lose light and truth by our own personal rebellion or by accepting human wisdom in place of the revealed word of God. Robinson & Garrett, A Commentary on the Doctrine and Covenants, 3:193-195.


    161
    Eternal truths cannot be contravened; things are as they are. Not even God can make what is eternally so into what is not. Truth will operate in its determined course whether human beings accept it or not, whether they believe it or not, or whether they even know of it or not. Similarly, beings possessing truth must also be allowed to operate according to their own choices. . . . This is the grand doctrine of agency. Eternal laws operate as they really are and cannot be contravened. Robinson & Garrett, A Commentary on the Doctrine and Covenants, 3:189.


    162
    The scholar can define the gospel as “all truth,” but the prophet cannot. Prophetic knowledge is not the result of abstract learning. It is not a mastery of theosophic principles or subtle theories. It is something found more naturally in service than in sequestered study. It is more the product of calloused hands than of a furrowed brow. It is more the child of the simple heart than the sire of eloquence of speech. It is something that rests closer to the heart than to the intellect. . . . It is an experiential knowledge of which the revelations speak. Just as we cannot describe colors to a man born blind, so we cannot convey the truths of heaven to those who have not been born of the Spirit. McConkie & Ostler, Revelations of the Restoration, 676-677.


    163
    Truth is always associated with light because truth can only be acquired through the power or the capacitating force of light. Without the faculty created by light, a fulness of truth could never be gained. . . . Light does the expansion. It enlarges, as it were, the mind. . .



    Light (the capacitating power) and enlightenment (or truth) are received by acquisition of celestial element through the Spirit of Christ to those who obey the word. First comes obedience to the word, then light, and finally truth. Thus, all—word, light, truth, spirit—become united. They are inseparably welded together so that a person cannot be touched by one without being touched by all. . .



    God is the One who sets the bounds and conditions that make cognition possible. He has determined that man will be glorified only as he receives truth. Man can receive a fulness of truth only as he receives a fullness of light. . . . Intelligence (man) is free to choose or reject light. When it (man) willfully rejects light, it (man) also rejects truth, and condemnation follows. Richard D. Draper, “Light, Truth, and Grace: Three Interrelated Principles Necessary for Exaltation,” BYU Devotional, BYU Speeches, July 7, 2009. 


    164
    The two greatest enemies of light and truth are disobedience and false traditions. Disobedience causes the light to withdraw; and, thus, what truths are left become distorted by dark shadows. “He that repents not,” the Lord said, “from him shall be taken even the light which he has received; for my Spirit shall not always strive with man, said the Lord of Hosts.” False traditions are also antithetical to truth, providing a convenient place to hide from the responsibility to listen, see, and know, thus ostensibly freeing the spiritually lethargic from the responsibility that inevitably follows knowledge of the truth. McConkie & Ostler, Revelations of the Restoration, 682.
