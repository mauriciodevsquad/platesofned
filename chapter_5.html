                    Just as a man does not really desire food until he is hungry, so he does not desire the salvation of Christ until he knows why he needs Christ. No one adequately and properly knows why he needs Christ until he understands and accepts the doctrine of the Fall and its effects upon all mankind. And no other book in the world explains this vital doctrine nearly as well as the Book of Mormon. </p>

                    The Fall and the Atonement are a package deal: the one brings the other into existence. . . . We do not appreciate and treasure the medicine until we appreciate the seriousness of the malady. We cannot look earnestly and longingly to the Redeemer if we do not sense the need for redemption. </p>

                    I submit to you that no one, regardless of race or creed, can ever understand the role of and the need for a savior and a redeemer unless he first knows from what he needs to be saved or redeemed. No person, regardless of his religion or tradition, can understand victory over death and the terms upon which his salvation depends unless he understands the doctrine of fallen man. </p>

                    The Atonement came because of the Fall. Christ paid the ransom for Adam’s transgression. If there had been no Fall, there would be no Atonement with its consequent immortality and eternal life. Thus, just as surely as salvation comes because of the Atonement, so also salvation comes because of the fall. . .<br><br>



                    The fall of Adam brought temporal and spiritual death into the world, and the atonement of Christ ransomed men from these two deaths by bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. This makes the Fall as essential a part of the plan of salvation as the very Atonement itself. </p>

                    The atonement is part of the eternal plan of the Father. It came at the appointed time, according to the will of the Father, to do for man that which could not have been done in any other way. The atonement is the child of the fall, and the fall is the father of the atonement. Neither of them, without the other, could have brought to pass the eternal purposes of the Father.<br><br>



                    The fall of Adam and the atonement of Christ are linked together –inseparably, everlastingly, never to be parted. They are as much a part of the same body as are the head and the heart, and each plays its part in the eternal scheme of things.<br><br>



                    The fall of Adam brought temporal and spiritual death into the world, and the atonement of Christ ransomed men from these two deaths by bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. This makes the fall as essential a part of the plan of salvation as the very atonement itself.<br><br>



                    Truly, salvation comes because of the fall, and it is just as important to believe in the fall as it is to believe in the atonement, and, indeed, it is not possible to believe in the atonement without believing in the fall. </p>

                    The Fall was designed---complete with all the accompanying misery and pain---to ultimately bring us freedom and happiness. There is no shortcut to the celestial kingdom. Everyone who ends up there must pass through the lone and dreary world on the way. God knew the problems associated with a mortal probation, but He also knew that Jesus would be the solution to those problems. </p>

                    The fact of the matter is that the story of the Fall—as told in scripture and the temple—is intended to give us more detail regarding our personal falls (as weak and sinful mortals) than about the Fall of historical figures, Adam and Eve. Each of the inspired, authorized accounts have been couched in such a way as to serve as a message about our need for obedience, the consequences of our sins, and our desperate need for a Savior to redeem us from our fallen condition. To misunderstand this is to misunderstand the Fall. </p>

                    The reason why it is important for us to know that God has a plan for the salvation of man, and that the plan includes the fall of man, is such knowledge dignifies the Fall and gives man a sense of security by removing the idea of chance or happenstance. The idea of a plan of God directs us to the conclusion that the Fall (1) was necessary, (2) was not a surprise to God, (3) was not an outright rebellion, (4) was an actual occurrence, and (5) is an essential part of the journey of man toward perfection. There may be other dimensions to the Fall, but the above conclusions are philosophically and doctrinally of basic importance for man to know while he lives on the earth as a mortal. </p>

                    It stands to reason that if we are fallen, then we must be fallen from someplace. We did not begin in a world like the one we now live in, nor is this natural world our proper setting. As spirit children of God, we first lived with heavenly parents in a glory which we now hope to return. In a sense, we are fallen from those celestial courts on high and are now looking for the ladder back up. Also, when our first parents were created physically on this earth, they were created in a more glorified state than we now experience, a condition roughly equivalent to a terrestrial glory, in which no one suffered or died. God created Adam and Eve nonmortal and immune to suffering, but these pleasant physical conditions changed for the worse with the Fall.



                    Thus humanity has digressed by degrees from the celestial, premortal world of our heavenly parents to the terrestrial Eden, and from thence has fallen hard to this telestial condition. In his redemptive work, Christ will reverse the process, first restoring the earth to its terrestrial or paradisiacal glory (the glory associated with Eden) and then after the Millennium raising earth to its ultimate celestial glory. </p>

                    Our knowledge about the Creation is limited. We do not know the how and the why and when of all things. Our infinite limitations are such that we could not comprehend them if they were revealed to us in all their glory, fullness, and perfection. What has been revealed is that portion of the Lord's eternal word which we must believe and understand if we are to envision the truth about the Fall and the Atonement and thus become heirs of salvation. </p>

                    How literally do we take the story of the Garden of Eden? This we know: Adam was real. He was as real as Christ. For if Adam was not real the Fall was not real; and if the Fall was not real the Atonement was not real; and if the Atonement was not real Jesus the Christ is not and was not necessary. Of some parts of the Eden story it matters little if we choose to view them as figurative or literal, but of others it is not so. The testimony of Christ, of necessity, embraces the testimony of Adam. Had there been no Eden there could be no Gethsemane; had there been no Eve there could be no Mary; if we have not inherited death from Adam, we have no claim on everlasting life through Christ. </p>

                    Why did God not simply create the world in such a condition that the plan would be underway from the beginning? Why did God place Adam and Eve in paradise with the anticipation that it and they would need to fail? I suggest a twofold answer. First, all things were created to be very good, because that is the nature of God and his work. God creates things that are organized, spiritual, and in harmony with his order. Second perhaps man needed to exercise his own agency to fall and die because God would not force those conditions on us. Yet if God would not impose the conditions of mortality on us, then it is reasonable to suggest that Adam and Eve, who made decisions that affect every human being, were not acting without our specific approval. Because they were representing us in what they did, it makes sense that in the premortal councils we sustained them to act in our behalf.

                    God did not make a mortal being. It would be contrary to his great goodness to make a man mortal, subject to pain, subject to sickness, subject to death. . . . If he had made them mortal, and subject to pain, there would have been some cause, among intelligent beings, to say that the Lord subjected man, without a cause, to afflictions, sorrows, death and mortality. But he could not do this; it was contrary to the nature of his attributes, contrary to the nature of that infinite goodness which dwells in the bosom of the Father and the Son, to make a being subject to any kind of pain. </p>

                    There was no mad scramble in heaven when Adam fell. The Fall was part of the plan from the beginning, and those present in the premortal world knew of it and accepted it even before the earth was created. . . . In the premortal council, Lucifer proposed that he would “redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost.” This suggests that the knowledge of a fall and the need for redemption were known to God’s spirit children before the creation of the earth. </p>

                    In my fullest belief, it was the design of the Lord that Adam should partake of the forbidden fruit, and I believe that Adam knew all about it before he came to this earth. I believe there was no other way leading to thrones and dominions only for him to transgress, or take that position which transgression alone could place man in, to descend below all things, that they might ascend to thrones, principalities, and powers; for they could not ascend to that eminence without first descending, nor upon any other principle. </p>

                    At first glance, it appears that God commanded Adam and Eve not to partake of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. But was that really the case? The first thing we should point out is that this commandment was very different from any other commandment the Lord has ever given in any dispensation, for this was the only time the Lord has given a commandment followed by the phrase, “nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee.”<br><br>



                    In effect the Lord said to Adam that he could partake of any tree in the Garden of Eden “freely” (or without consequences) except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil. That was the only tree that could not be partaken of “freely.” In other words, that tree was the only tree which would bring consequences to those who partook. . .<br><br>



                    Remember the Lord does not give commandments and then suggest that disobedience is an option. What then did the Lord forbid? He did not forbid Adam to partake of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Rather, He forbid Adam to partake of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil freely. There is a big difference. The Lord simply forbid that Adam partake of this tree consequence free . . .<br><br>



                    Why did God give Adam and Eve a commandment that they could not keep, unless they first broke another one of God’s commandments? The answer: He didn’t . . .<br><br>



                    This explanation helps us understand that Adam and Eve were not given contradictory commandments in the Garden of Eden. It explains that Adam and Eve were able to keep all of God’s commandments, and that they did not have to break one of God’s in order to keep another. </p>

                    What, therefore, did God really say to them in the garden? I suggest that He might have said something like the following: “If you want to stay in the Garden of Eden with no cares and no possibility of growth, you should not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. However, if you desire to grow and receive all that I have in store for you, you will have to leave the garden. If you eat of the tree, you will be cast out of the garden into the earth and into mortality, and you will die both temporally and spiritually, but you will open the door for yourselves and for all humanity to receive eternal life like I have. The choice is yours.” In other words, God gave them information. </p>

                    God’s son and daughter had done what needed to be done: Adam and Eve had used their agency to enter mortality so that man might be. Together they embarked on an extraordinarily difficult journey, fraught with trials and hazards—a life ruled by the natural laws of the sphere in which they now dwelled and of which they had no practical knowledge. Before they departed from their paradisiacal Eden, these beloved children of our Heavenly Father received counsel and teachings about the challenges and realities that their newly mortal bodies would face in their earthly existence. </p>

                    Some may regret that our first parents sinned. This is nonsense. If we had been there, and they had not sinned, we should have sinned. I will not blame Adam or Eve, why? Because it was necessary that sin should enter into the world; no man could ever understand the principle of exaltation without its opposite; no one could ever receive an exaltation without being acquainted with its opposite. How did Adam and Even sin? Did they come out in direct opposition to God and to His government? No. But they transgressed a command of the Lord, and through that transgression sin came into the world. The Lord knew they would do this, and He had designed that they should. </p>

                    If our Father in Heaven places man on the earth he would force man into a situation of sin. The very definition of mortality is that which is corruptible, that which is sin, that which deteriorates, all that is opposite to God, who is incorruptible, perfect, and eternal. So how does God make man mortal? He does not! God cannot force man to become mortal for if he does he sins himself. God cannot sin and remain one hundred percent perfect. If he were to sin he would cease to be as he is, God. This is an important concept in understanding the plan of salvation.<br><br>



                    If our Father in Heaven forces man to become mortal, the responsibility for that sin is his. The burden of reclamation and reconciliation of man would also be the responsibility of God. This is very important to understand because justice, that which maintains order through our eternity, must be satisfied. If God were to take upon himself the sin of man’s mortality he would be forced to answer and satisfy the demands of justice; for if he does not he ceases to be God. Justice would demand payment.<br><br>



                    It now becomes an impossibility for God to place man into the situation of mortality. What about the great force of mercy? Cannot mercy, in this situation, satisfy the demands of justice? Cannot God enact mercy on behalf of mankind and redeem them back into his presence? The answer is no. . . . Our Father in Heaven has no mercy in himself to give. Why is he God? Because he is 100% just. If any mercy were to be found in him, he would cease to be God. In this predicament how does God place man in a situation of mortality and enact mercy? The answer to both questions is the same. He cannot do either one. For him to do either one is unworkable.<br><br>



                    The only alternative available to fulfill an eternal plan of salvation is for man to enact both situations upon himself. Man must place himself in a position of mortality and man must redeem himself back into God’s presence. . . . Both death and resurrection have come into the world through man. . . . This is the only way the integrity of God and our eternal existence is maintained. Man must bring upon himself a state of opposition and mortality. He must also bring himself back into harmony with justice and eternity. This is the only way to maintain the purity of the plan of salvation and the perfection of God.

                    The creation of the world (and man) was done in a perfect, holy, and innocent state. To have done otherwise would have been contrary to the nature of God, which sets up an interesting problem.

                    If man is to have his agency of choice, he must have opposites from which to choose. If opposites do not exist then neither does the agency to choose. Lucifer did not want to force everyone to choose the right, as much as he wanted to remove the principle of opposition. Good and evil must be present before man to allow him the opportunity to be as God, knowing good and evil.<br><br>



                    Because of opposition, man has his agency. Some have presupposed incorrectly that after this life, when we are living in heaven that all evil will be extinguished into non existence. How could this be? If that were to be true, then all good would be extinguished as well. To destroy something completely is to also destroy its opposite. Opposition never goes away; we must learn to control the evil and enjoy the good. That thought alone brings another dimension to the plan of salvation and makes this life all the more important. </p>

                    From the beginning, agency and opposition were central to the Father’s plan and to Satan’s rebellion . . . Satan’s proposal would have ensured perfect equality: it would “redeem all mankind,” that not one soul would be lost. There would be no agency or choice by anyone and, therefore, no need for opposition. There would be no test, no failure, and no success. There would be no growth to attain the purpose the Father desired for His children. . .<br><br>



                    Cast down as unembodied spirits in mortality, Satan and his followers tempt and seek to deceive and captivate the children of God. So it is that the evil one, who opposed and sought to destroy the Father’s plan, actually facilitated it, because it is opposition that enables choice and it is the opportunity of making the right choices that leads to the growth that is the purpose of the Father’s plan . . .<br><br>



                    All of us experience various kinds of opposition that test us. Some of these tests are temptations to sin. Some are mortal challenges apart from personal sin. Some are very great. Some are minor. Some are continuous, and some are mere episodes. None of us is exempt. Opposition permits us to grow toward what our Heavenly Father would have us become.

                    Our Father in heaven makes use of the evil designs of the devil. God allows His fallen son to tempt the children of men, so that they may more deliberately choose between good and evil. The Lord could banish Satan and his angels from earth, and remove temptation from men, but in His wisdom He permits His wayward bodiless children to come upon earth. Thus, despite their intentions, the followers of Satan are so used as to help accomplish the divine purpose. Whether understood by the evil one or not, in his efforts among mankind he is made an instrument to secure the very plan that he opposed in the Great Council.

                    Such was the problem before our first parents: to remain forever at selfish ease in the Garden of Eden, or to face unselfishly tribulation and death, in bringing to pass the purposes of the Lord for a host of waiting spirit children. They chose the latter. This they did with open eyes and minds as to consequences. The memory of their former estates [including their premortal spirit existence] may have been dimmed, but the gospel had been taught them during their sojourn [stay] in the Garden of Eden. . . . The choice that they made raises Adam and Eve to preeminence among all who have come on earth.

                    Latter-day Saints view the Fall with an optimism that is uncharacteristic of most of the Christian world. It is an optimism born of the conviction that Adam and Eve went into the Garden of Eden to fall, that the Fall was as much a part of the foreordained plan of the Father as the Atonement. We believe they did precisely what needed to be done, that the Fall had a twofold direction—downward, yet forward. It brought man into the world and set his feet upon progression’s highway.

                    This earth life is set up according to true principles, and these conditions that followed the transgression [of Adam] were not, in the usual sense, penalties that were inflicted upon us. All these . . . that seem to be sad inflictions of punishment, sorrow, and trouble are in the end not that. They are blessings. We have attained a knowledge of good and evil, the power to prize the sweet, to become agents unto ourselves, the power to obtain redemption and eternal life. These things had their origin in this transgression. The Lord has set the earth up so we have to labor if we are going to live, which preserves us from the curse of idleness and indolence; and though the Lord condemns us to death—mortal death—it is one of the greatest blessings that comes to us here because it is the doorway to immortality, and we can never attain immortality without dying.<br><br>



                    So these are all real blessings. We come to the earth with all these conditions arranged as they are so that we have to struggle constantly against evil, struggle to preserve our lives, struggle for everything of true value—that is the thing for us to understand—this is the course of life that is most desirable, and for our good. We have no need to find fault with these conditions. The Lord has ordained them all for our welfare and happiness. </p>

                    What did Adam and Eve know after they returned to God’s presence that they hadn’t known when they were originally with him in the Garden? What can we know after our own return to God that we didn’t know in our premortal life? The scriptures explain that God expected and desired that Adam and Eve’s children would have the same kinds of mortal experiences as their first parents had, which suggests that the redemption of Adam and Eve was not just a convenient way to erase the effect of an unfortunate error. Rather, it was an intentional element in a course of instruction designed by God himself for their preparation, if they freely chose to accept it. Without that course of instruction, they could not have developed the capacity to live a meaningful celestial life. So it is with our experience as their children: Mortality is not mere estrangement from God—it is the crucible through which the possibility of truly meaningful life becomes real. </p>

                    The Fall was neither a tragedy nor a mistake but a necessary step in the eternal progress of God’s spirit children, for we had reached the point in our premortal growth where it was time to meet the opposition in a mortal setting, to encounter the evil and negative elements of existence, and to be sorted out according to our response to that opposition. Mortality is the sorting shed. Here some of us will pursue light most of the time no matter what the cost; some will pursue light some of the time if it doesn’t cost too much; and others will prefer darkness. Unfortunately, our real preferences can be fairly tested only on a level playing floor, that is, in a place where light and darkness, good and evil, are both readily available to us equally, “for it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.”<br><br>



                    Mortality is designed to offer those conditions. Mortal life is like an all-you-can-eat buffet dinner with all the moral options spread out before us, from the pure, the virtuous, the righteous, and the holy at one end of the table to the abominable, the wicked, the corrupt, and the vile at the other end. Pick what you like; eat all you want; but your choices will unmistakably reveal what you prefer and therefore what you are. When we can have all we want of whatever we want, our choices unerringly reveal our true character. In this analogy, you are what you eat. In real life, you are what you choose.<br><br>



                    However, the environment necessary for this test, this buffet dinner with good and evil presented on the same table, with the opposition present in all things, could not be created in the presence of God, for “no unclean thing can dwell in his presence”. </p>

                    Since the Fall (the separation from God that allows us to be enticed equally by both good and evil) was necessary to human progress rather than being a tragic misstep, in fact since God fully intended that the Fall take place, it would be grossly unfair for God to punish Adam and Eve for it. After all, the Garden of Eden was pretty much a setup for the Fall to occur. For that reason, after Adam and Eve were cast out, God forgave them their transgression in the Garden of Eden and absolved them of any blame for it. They were assured they would not be blamed for what occurred before the Fall nor for the Fall itself. Rather, since the Fall was part of God’s plan, all its negative aspects would unconditionally and unilaterally be canceled out for them and their posterity through the grace of God and the atonement of Jesus Christ, who alone would bear the burden of the Fall.<br><br>



                    However, those sins committed by Adam and Eve and their posterity after the Fall, by their own free choice and with full knowledge and accountability, can be forgiven only through the atonement of Christ by entering into the gospel covenant—also by our own free choice. Please note the parallel: The negative effects of the Fall that came about without our participation (sickness, death, and so on) are also canceled without our participation. The negative effects brought about with our participation (our own sins) are canceled only with our participation in the gospel covenant. </p>
