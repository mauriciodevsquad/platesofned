                    It is in the order of heavenly things that God should always send a new dispensation into the world when men have apostatized from the truth and lost the priesthood. . .

                    <br><br>

                    It is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time. And not only this, but those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the dispensation of the fullness of times. . .
                    <br><br>


                    When men come out and build upon other men’s foundations, they do it on their own responsibility, without authority from God. </p>

                    In preparation for this restoration the Lord raised up noble men, such as Luther, Calvin, Knox, and others. . . . Latter-day Saints pay all honor to these great and fearless reformers, who shattered the fetters which bound the religious world. The Lord was their Protector in this mission, which was fraught with many perils. In that day, however, the time had not come for the restoration of the fullness of the gospel. The work of the reformers was of great importance, but it was a preparatory work. </p>

                    Although the Reformers were great men, they were not prophets called by God. They still taught some misconceptions such as faith without works, predestination, and certain erroneous doctrines concerning the sacrament and baptism. Nonetheless, their influence was profound and their contribution significant. It was a giant step forward. The Renaissance and the Reformation were not ends in and of themselves, but rather the means to yet a greater light–the Restoration. </p>

                    Elder Orson F. Whitney, an Apostle of the restored Church, once told of a learned Catholic theologian who spoke to him as follows:

                    <br><br>

                    You Mormons are all ignoramuses. You don’t even know the strength of your own position. It is so strong that there is only one other tenable in the whole Christian world, and that is the position of the Catholic Church. The issue is between Catholicism and Mormonism. If we are right, you are wrong; if you are right, we are wrong; and that’s all there is to it. The Protestants haven’t a leg to stand on. For if we are wrong, they are wrong with us, since they were a part of us and went out from us; while if we are right, they are apostates whom we cut off long ago. If we have the apostolic succession from St. Peter, as we claim, there is no need of Joseph Smith and Mormonism; but if we have not that succession, then such a man as Joseph Smith was necessary, and Mormonism’s attitude is the only consistent one. It is either the perpetuation of the gospel from ancient times, or the restoration of the gospel in latter days. </p>

                    Although the Church was very small in the beginning, Joseph Smith had a prophetic sense of its grand destiny. Wilford Woodruff recalled that during a priesthood meeting at Kirtland, Ohio, in April 1834, the Prophet tried to awaken the brethren to a realization of the future state of God’s kingdom on earth:

                    <br><br>

                    “The Prophet called on all who held the Priesthood to gather into the little log school house they had there. It was a small house, perhaps 14 feet square. But it held the whole of the Priesthood of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who were then in the town of Kirtland. . . . When we got together the Prophet called upon the Elders of Israel with him to bear testimony of this work. . . . When they got through the Prophet said, “Brethren, I have been very much edified and instructed in your testimonies here tonight, but I want to say to you before the Lord, that you know no more concerning the destinies of this Church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother’s lap. You don’t comprehend it. It is only a little handful of Priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America—it will fill the world.” </p>

                    Joseph Smith received a revelation declaring The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth.” What does that mean? It does not mean that other churches do not have some truth, for they certainly do. It does not mean that other churches do not render good—they render much good. What it does mean is that the LDS Church is the only church that has all the gospel truth revealed in this day and age, the only church that has the ordinances necessary for the salvation of men and women, and the only church that has the priesthood power of God to perform those ordinances with divine validity. Accordingly, this is the only church to match Christ’s original blueprint in all material respects. The corollary between the blueprint set forth in the New Testament and Christ’s restored Church today is one of God’s compelling witnesses to us of His true Church on earth. </p>

                    The Church of Jesus Christ is not true because its members try harder than those of other faiths to please God; rather, the Church is true because Christ Himself established, authorized, and acknowledges the continuing work therein as valid and eternal. The Church is true because it possesses the necessary authority, ordinances, and true doctrine, all of which are bestowed by God. </p>

                    The position that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the only true church upon the face of the earth is fundamental. Perhaps it would be more convenient and palatable and popular if we were to avoid it; nevertheless, we are under a sacred obligation and a sacred trust to hold to it. It is not merely an admission; it is a positive declaration. It is so fundamental that we cannot yield on this point. </p>

                    If fullness of truth or fullness of the gospel means that all the answers relative to God and to eternal salvation are already found in the teachings and practices of the Church as presently constituted, there would be no need for additional revelation, whether institutional or personal. If we have all the answers, then we have no questions, and if we run out of questions, then we cease to learn or to seek for diving guidance. . .

                    <br><br>

                    What, then, is the fullness of the gospel? I would suggest that the term fullness should be more closely associated with an idea of sufficiency rather than a completeness. The Church administers all the necessary ordinances and teaches all the key principles which lead to eternal life, but it does not claim that additional, expanded, or reworded knowledge of truth would be useless in the process of achieving this same objective. In short, fullness understood as perfection or completion, whether in knowledge or action, is always necessarily an objective ahead of us, not a condition already achieved. </p>

                    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has no desire to move into the mainstream of Christianity. We are what we are and we believe what we believe. We profess to be "Christian, but different." Those differences---such as a belief in an apostasy, or falling away of the primitive Christian Church; the need for a restoration through a modern prophet, Joseph Smith; an expanded canon of scripture; the restoration of priesthood or divine authority by heavenly messengers; the place of temples, eternal marriage, and forever families, etc.---clearly set us apart from more traditional Christians. Our strength, however, lies in our distinctiveness. People are not joining our Church because we believe the same things as the Roman Catholics or Methodists or Lutherans or Greek Orthodox down the street or across town. </p>

                    The Church is the authorized repository and safeguard for the essential doctrine, priesthood authority and keys, and holy ordinances and covenants that enable the sons and daughters of God to progress according to the Father’s eternal plan of happiness.

                    <br><br>

                    How does His Church accomplish the Lord’s purposes? It is important to recognize that God’s ultimate purpose is our progress. His desire is that we continue ‘from grace to grace, until we receive a fulness’ of all He can give. That requires more than simply being nice or feeling spiritual. It requires faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism of water and of the spirit, and enduring in faith to the end. One cannot fully achieve this in isolation, so a major reason the Lord has a church is to create a community of Saints that will sustain one another in the ‘strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life.’ </p>

                    The Church is the means, the vehicle, for salvation. Through the Church we receive the ordinances of salvation. Through the Church we sing and preach and rejoice. Through the Church we learn to love and serve one another, to contribute to the edification and growth of the body of Christ, to participate in a system of organized sacrifice. But our hope for salvation is not in a system, not in an organization, not in a program, inspired and God-ordained though they may be. Our hope is in Christ.

                    As one who has seen firsthand the councils and workings of this Church, I bear solemn witness that no decision of significance affecting this Church or its members is ever made without earnestly seeking the inspiration, guidance, and approbation of our Eternal Father. This is the Church of Jesus Christ. God will not allow His Church to drift from its appointed course or fail to fulfill its divine destiny. </p>

                    For some reason, when some people find out something about the Church that they did not previously know, they feel betrayed and believe the Church was trying to hide something from them. Then they make it their life's mission to expose every little mistake the Church or its leaders have made in the past to the present. But seriously, no one---ever---in this church has ever claimed that there haven't been mistakes along the way. What we do say is that the Church is a living church! Meaning that if a policy or interpretation is incorrect or just needs to be updated or changed, then the Lord can put us on the right track. That's what makes the Church true and unique. The Church is evolving and moving toward perfection in much the same way as we are. Line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little . . . but never all at once. Revelation takes place and change occurs inside the Church . . . slowly . . . for a reason. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    The Lord makes course corrections in His own time and for His own reasons. Faulty interpretations, policies, and understandings are not uprooted all at once for purposes only known to God Himself. The key is to wait upon the Lord. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    We have no doctrine of infallibility in our Church. We believe that the Restoration is still taking place---even today---and that it will continue until the Savior comes to reign personally upon the earth. It's important to understand that the doctrine of Christ does not and will not change. There are certain doctrines that are the same yesterday, today, and forever. These doctrines are central to the plan of salvation. Policy is completely different than doctrine. </p>

                    One of the beautiful things to me in the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that it brings us all to a common level. It is not necessary for a man to be a president of a stake, or a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, in order to attain a high place in the celestial kingdom. The humblest member of the Church, if he keeps the commandments of God, will obtain an exaltation just as much as any other man in the celestial kingdom. The beauty of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that it makes us all equal in as far as we keep the commandments of the Lord. In as far as we observe to keep the laws of the Church we have equal opportunities for exaltation.

                    Mark Twain is often quoted as having said: “The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.” For many, the second great day has not yet come. The discovery and acceptance of Christ’s true Church is critical in that pursuit because it not only provides the answer, but it also provides the teachings and ordinances and power necessary to achieve our divine purpose. </p>

                    Before you joined the Church you stood on neutral ground. When the gospel was preached good and evil were set before you. You could choose either or neither. There were two opposite masters inviting you to serve them. When you joined this Church you enlisted to serve God. When you did that you left the neutral ground, and you never can get back on to it. Should you forsake the Master you enlisted to serve, it will be by the instigation of the evil one, and you will follow his dictation and be his servant. </p>

                    The most important prophet, so far as we are concerned, is the one who is living in our day and age. This is the prophet who has today’s instructions from God to us today. God’s revelation to Adam did not instruct Noah how to build the ark. Every generation has need of the ancient scriptures plus the current scripture from the living prophet. </p>

                    There isn't any doubt in my mind that the man who becomes the President of the Church is schooled and disciplined by the Lord over a long period of time for this responsibility. In that process his individuality is not blurred; rather it is sharpened. The Lord trains a man and disciplines him. He tests his heart and his substance. And in a natural process that He directs, He moves through the Quorum of the Twelve a man to become the senior apostle who on the death of the President becomes the President of the Church. There is no campaigning but only the quiet operation of a divine plan that provides inspired and tested leadership. The Lord is at the helm of this work, and the President of the Church is an instrument in His hands to carry forward this work and to strengthen His kingdom. </p>

                    When the Spirit teaches prophets the truth of things as they really are, this includes sensitizing these special men to the implications of what is just beginning, implications that are imperceptible to others. Prophets are alerted to tiny trends that bode ill for mankind. Prophets, therefore, are the Lord's early-warning system: they both detect and decry at his direction. What may seem to be a premature expression of prophetic concern is actually the early discovery of a difficulty that will later plague the people. </p>

                    Another fallacy is to believe that the choice to accept or not accept the counsel of prophets is no more than deciding whether to accept good advice and gain its benefits or to stay where we are. But the choice not to take prophetic counsel changes the very ground upon which we stand. It becomes more dangerous. The failure to take prophetic counsel lessens our power to take inspired counsel in the future. The best time to have decided to help Noah build the ark was the first time he asked. Each time he asked after that, each failure to respond would have lessened sensitivity to the Spirit. And so each time his request would have seemed more foolish, until the rain came. And then it was too late. </p>

                    The Lord's frequent, repeated warnings about listening to His prophets raise the question: What does stoning and casting out prophets, seers, and revelators look like today?

                    Some of the opposition the Church faces comes from Church members. Some who use personal reasoning or wisdom to resist prophetic direction give themselves a label borrowed from elected bodies---'the loyal opposition.' However appropriate for a democracy, there is no warrant for this concept in the government of God's kingdom, where questions are honored but opposition is not.

                    <br><br>

                    There are many things in our early Church history, such as what Joseph did or did not do in every circumstance, that some use as a basis for opposition. To all I say, exercise faith and put reliance on the Savior's teaching that we should 'know them by their fruits.' </p>

                    Church members will live in this wheat-and-tares situation until the Millennium. Some real tares even masquerade as wheat, including the few eager individuals who lecture the rest of us about Church doctrines in which they no longer believe. They criticize the use of Church resources to which they no longer contribute. They condescendingly seek to counsel the Brethren whom they no longer sustain. Confrontive, except of themselves, of course, they leave the Church, but they cannot leave the Church alone. </p>

                    You take a shepherd, for instance; and, according to the ancient practice, we learn that they always went forward and prepared the way, so that there could be no danger in advance but what the shepherd would learn of in time to save the sheep. If they are allowed to run by the shepherd, the wolves are apt to catch them and destroy them; and the very moment that men in this kingdom attempt to run ahead or cross the path of their leaders, no matter in what respect, the moment they do this they are in danger of being injured by the wolves. . . .



                    I have never in my life known it to fail, that when men went contrary to the counsel of their leaders, either in the days of Joseph or brother Brigham, they always became entangled and suffered a loss by so doing.</p>

                    God’s prophets never set themselves up as the light but rather stand on the mountain pointing people to the true Light. Prophets instruct people to learn from their teachings and from their lives, which include many wonderful acts of righteousness as well as the sin and error that are the lot of all humanity. In that way prophets doubly fulfill their calling to encourage all in the sound of their voice to become perfected in and through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Prophets are not called to save us; they are called to lead us to the Savior. </p>

                    In our well-intentioned, and in many ways honorable, defense of Joseph Smith’s (and Brigham Young’s and Thomas S. Monson’s) good name, we sometimes fall into the trap—laid by Joseph’s critics—that the central issue at stake in determining the validity of the restoration’s salvific message is the personal character of the prophets who are its messengers. Unintentionally adopting the false argument of the church’s opponents, we have occasionally confused and conflated the quality of messenger and message. But to expect prophets to be perfect, to be troubled by anything that falls short of what we perceive as a celestial paradigm, and to make it an ironclad requirement that prophets be 100 percent right 100 percent of the time supposes that God’s call overrides human agency. </p>

                    Now, was not Joseph Smith a mortal man? Yes. A fallible man? Yes. Had he not weaknesses? Yes, he acknowledged them himself, and did not fail to put the revelations on record wherein God reproved him. His weaknesses were not concealed from the people. He was willing that people should know that he was mortal, and had failings. And so with Brigham Young. Was not he a mortal man, a man who had weaknesses? He was not a God. He was not an immortal being. He was not infallible. No, he was fallible. And yet when he spoke by the power of God, it was the word of God to this people. The First Presidency cannot claim, individually or collectively, infallibility. The infallibility is not given to men. They are fallible. </p>

                    I can support the President of this Church: I can support his first counselor and I can support his second counselor, and yet know there were many weaknesses that pertain to those men which I did not feel to approve of, and yet I can fellowship them. I can fellowship the President of the Church if he does not know everything I know, or everything he ought to know, or if he does things which I may not think he ought to do. I saw Joseph Smith the Prophet do things which I did not approve of; and yet when I saw the weaknesses and imperfections in him I thanked God that He would put upon a man who had these imperfections the power and authority which he placed upon him. I respected Joseph Smith and I was pleased to see those weaknesses for I knew I myself had weakness and I thought there was a chance for me. These weaknesses I knew were in Joseph Smith and these weaknesses I knew were in Heber C. Kimball but my knowing this did not impair them in my estimation. I thanked God I saw these imperfections. </p>

                    Can we believe that fallible human beings can also be conduits for the Lord’s will? Can a prophet be inspired and in error, even on the same day or in the same sermon? Do we believe our bishops and stake presidents can be trusted to carry out the Lord’s will in their jurisdictions, which our theology states is just as significant and sacred as the prophet’s stewardship over the entire church? Can we ourselves, with all our flaws, filters, and prejudices, nonetheless be genuinely inspired of the Lord? Do we really believe that the “weak things of the world” can be agents of God? It is a daring assertion, but it is a crucial element of our religion. Part of the essence of Mormonism is trusting the revelation of other fallible human beings. In a secular age already suffering from a deficit of trust, this is perhaps one of our greatest collective challenges. Our leaders, like ourselves, have made and will continue to make mistakes, sometimes grave ones. We can only hope that we will all learn to correct our transgressions—to repent—and go on, still confident that God is with us. </p>

We are here to assist our Father in His work and His glory, “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). Your obligation is as serious in your sphere of responsibility as is my obligation in my sphere. No calling in this church is small or of little consequence. All of us in the pursuit of our duty touch the lives of others. . . . The progress of this work will be determined by our joint efforts. Whatever your calling, it is as fraught with the same kind of opportunity to accomplish good as is mine. What is really important is that this is the work of the Master.

                    I want to say something about this matter of service in various positions in the Church. . . . Every time there is a vacancy in a bishopric, a stake presidency, or among the General Authorities there are those in the ward, stake, or Church generally who begin to speculate and wonder whether they ought to be called. . . .Now the fact is that there are usually many men who could fill any position, who could take any vacancy that arises and do it honorably and well, building up the kingdom and furthering the work. But some individual has to be called to do it. It is certain that whoever is called, thereby becomes the Lord’s anointed, and even if the Lord would have preferred someone else yet the one called is entitled to inspiration and if he seeks to magnify his calling to the full, he will come off triumphant in the work assigned. But, my point is that it does not matter what position we have in life that counts, what does matter is how we keep the commandments. The family unit and working in the cause of righteousness is more important than any position. Service is essential to salvation, but the place where we serve is not.


                    <br><br>
                    Years ago I was appointed to attend a quarterly conference that was holding forth in the Assembly Hall on Temple Square. At the time, George F. Richards was the President of the Council of the Twelve. He did not have an assignment of his own and so he came and attended my stake conference and of course, was the concluding speaker in the various sessions. In one of the meetings I was talking about magnifying one’s calling in the priesthood and thereby working out an inheritance of exaltation and receiving all that the Father hath. . . . President George F. Richards followed me and spoke on the same general theme. One of the things that he said was this in substance. “There are many people in the Church who hold no position at all but who in eternity will have higher positions than many of the Council of the Twelve.” He was talking on this general theme that it does not matter where we serve but how. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Now I do not have the slightest doubt that there will be a complete realignment of church positions and responsibilities in the life to come. People who have low positions here will receive high ones there. It may be that some who have relatively high positions here will be in lesser positions there. . .

                    <br><br>

                    What is going to count eventually in eternity, is the family organization, the patriarchal system, which goes from father to son. The thing that counts will not be what position someone held in the Church in any dispensation, but rather how he lived and whether he is entitled to exaltation and his place in the patriarchal order.

                    We have done very well at distributing the authority of the priesthood. We have priesthood authority planted nearly everywhere. We have quorums of elders and high priests worldwide. But distributing the authority of the priesthood has raced, I think, ahead of distributing the power of the priesthood. The priesthood does not have the strength that it should have and will not have until the power of the priesthood is firmly fixed in the families as it should be. . . .

                    The priesthood conferred upon us is the very same power and authority through which God created this and numberless worlds, governs the heavens and the earth, and exalts His obedient children. . .

                    <br><br>

                    I fear that there are too many men who have been given the authority of the priesthood but who lack priesthood power because the flow of power has been blocked by sins such as laziness, dishonesty, pride, immorality, or preoccupation with things of the world.

                    <br><br>

                    I fear that there are too many priesthood bearers who have done little or nothing to develop their ability to access the powers of heaven. I worry about all who are impure in their thoughts, feelings, or actions or who demean their wives or children, thereby cutting off priesthood power.

                    <br><br>

                    I fear that too many have sadly surrendered their agency to the adversary and are saying by their conduct, “I care more about satisfying my own desires than I do about bearing the Savior’s power to bless others.”

                    Even though those in authority lay hands upon our heads and we are ordained, we may through our behavior nullify and forfeit any right to exercise this divine authority . . . . The priesthood is not a cloak that we put on and take off at will. It is, when exercised in righteousness, as the very tissue of our bodies, a part of us at all times and in all circumstances.

                    <br><br>

                    Many men seem to think that because they have been ordained, the priesthood is theirs in perpetuity to exercise as they choose. They feel they can break a covenant and a commandment here and there, and sin in this way or that, and yet still have within themselves the power of the priesthood and that God will ratify that which they speak in His holy name and in the name of the Redeemer. This becomes mockery, and I believe that in such an exercise, they take the name of God in vain. They profane the name of His Beloved Son. They desecrate the sacred gift which came through ordination . . .

                    <br><br>

                    I am satisfied that our Father in Heaven is not pleased with any man or boy who accepts ordination and then indulges in evil. In the very process of accepting ordination he enters into an oath and covenant between himself and his God. </p>

                    Priesthood is more than just an abstract agency granted by the Lord to speak or act in his name. It is also authority sanctioned or consented to by peers. Unless a person in a position of authority has the consent or approval of those over whom he or she exercises authority, then that authority lacks power---in essence, it is meaningless or empty. </p>

                    The Atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ provides the way through gospel ordinances and sacred covenants to return to the presence of God. Because we would live in a mortal environment filled with danger and distractions, Heavenly Father and His Son knew we would need access to power greater than our own. They knew we would need access to Their power. The gospel and doctrine of Christ give all who will accept it power to achieve eternal life and power to find joy in the journey. . . .


                    <br><br>
                    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s Church, and His Church is governed by and through priesthood authority and priesthood keys. Priesthood keys are the authority God has given to priesthood leaders to direct, control, and govern the use of His priesthood on earth. The exercise of priesthood authority is governed by those who hold its keys. . .


                    <br><br>
                    In our Heavenly Father’s great priesthood-endowed plan, men have the unique responsibility to administer the priesthood, but they are not the priesthood. Men and women have different but equally valued roles. Just as a woman cannot conceive a child without a man, so a man cannot fully exercise the power of the priesthood to establish an eternal family without a woman. . . . In the eternal perspective, both the procreative power and the priesthood power are shared by husband and wife. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    This matter, like many others, comes down to our faith. Do we believe that this is the Lord’s Church? Do we believe that He has organized it according to His purposes and wisdom? Do we believe that His wisdom far exceeds ours? Do we believe that He has organized His Church in a manner that would be the greatest possible blessing to all of His children, both His sons and His daughters? . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Men and women are equal in God’s eyes and in the eyes of the Church, but equal does not mean, brothers and sisters, that they are the same. The responsibilities and divine gifts of men and woman differ in their nature but not in their importance or influence. Our Church doctrine places women equal to and yet different from men. God does not regard either gender as better or more important than the other. . . .


                    <br><br>
                    Men and women have different gifts, different strengths, and different points of view and inclinations. That is one of the fundamental reasons why we need each other. It takes a man and a woman to create a family, and it takes men and women to carry out the work of the Lord in the Church. A husband and wife righteously working together complete each other. Let us be careful that we do not attempt to tamper with our Heavenly Father’s plan and purposes in our lives.

                    <br><br>

                    When men and women go to the temple, they are both endowed with the same power, which by definition is priesthood power. While the authority of the priesthood is directed through priesthood keys, and priesthood keys are held only by worthy men, access to the power and the blessings of the priesthood is available to all of God’s children. . . . All who enter the house of the Lord officiate in the ordinances of the priesthood. This applies to men and women alike. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Do not spend time trying to overhaul or adjust God’s plan. We do not have time for such. It is a pointless exercise to try and determine how to organize the Lord’s Church differently. The Lord is at the head of this Church, and we all follow His direction. </p>

                    Too many sisters as well as priesthood bearers think LDS woman don’t have access to priesthood power. But that is not true. Women who have been endowed in the temple have as much access to priesthood power for their own lives as do ordained men.
                    <br><br>


                    Four key points underscore this truth: First, priesthood keys are the manner through which the Lord authorizes the use of and distributes His power, for both women and men.

                    <br><br>

                    Second, there are distinctions between priesthood keys, priesthood authority, and priesthood power. Priesthood keys are required to authorize ordinances, priesthood authority is required to perform ordinances, and priesthood power is available to all who worthily receive ordinances and keep the associated covenants.
                    <br><br>


                    Third, both men and women who serve under the direction of priesthood keys serve with divine authority. . . . Whoever functions in an office or calling received from one who holds priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties.
                    <br><br>


                    And finally, fourth, men and women have equal access to the Lord’s highest spiritual privileges. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the house of the Lord. When men and women go to the temple, they are both endowed with the same power, which by definition is priesthood power. </p>

                    Priesthood power blesses all of us. Priesthood keys direct women as well as men, and priesthood ordinances and priesthood authority pertain to women as well as men. . . .


                    <br><br>
                    While the sisters have not been given the Priesthood, it has not been conferred upon them, that does not mean that the Lord has not given unto them authority. . . . A person may have authority given to him, or a sister to her, to do certain things in the Church that are binding and absolutely necessary for our salvation, such as the work that our sisters do in the House of the Lord. They have authority given unto them to do great and wonderful things, sacred unto the Lord, and binding just as thoroughly as are the blessings that are given by the men who hold the Priesthood. </p>

                    An act or ritual done with proper priesthood authority is known as an ordinance. All ordinances are instructive—designed to bring people closer to God and Christ and to bless them in some manner.


                    <br><br>
                    Some ordinances are essential for salvation in the celestial kingdom of God. . . . Saving ordinances for Latter-day Saints include baptism for the remission of sins and the accompanying worthy partaking of the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, confirmation and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, ordination to the priesthood for all worthy males, and the temple ordinances of endowment and sealings. With each of these imperative ordinances, there are associated covenants by which the person receiving the ordinance promises to live his or her life. Accompanying these ordinances are also promises God makes to the faithful who live their lives in accordance with the covenants.

                    <br><br>

                    Not only do ordinances set things in order within the Church and kingdom of God but they also have real power in the lives of those who faithfully receive them. </p>

                    Ordinances, in the sense of rituals and ceremonies, embrace the entire mortal life of God’s sons and daughters and are performed by the Lord’s authorized representatives, the bearers of his priesthood. Indeed, ordinances are the visable aspect of priesthood efficacy, the operation of proper divine authority conferred upon mortal man. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    Ordinances reflect the truth that the Lord’s Church is a house of order. They also remind members of their standing in God’s kingdom on earth. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    When ordinances are performed with authority and power, they are followed by divine blessings. They have efficacy, virtue, and force. They are enlightening to the mind and enlivening to the whole soul.

                    The complaint that ordinances of salvation are arbitrary misses the point. They are arbitrary in order to fulfill their purpose. . . Ordinances make possible our response to God’s invitation. We are enabled to formalize and constitute a living, dynamic relationship through a set of ritual performances. We willfully and bodily participate in the forging of that relationship. </p>

                    Through ordinances we use our bodies to enact our love of Christ and the saints, our hope for a better world and a better us. Physical ordinances recognize that we can and should devote our whole souls, both our spirit and our bodies, to goodness and to God. In the ordinances, spirit and body are brought together in the presence of God. By emphasizing a religion that includes both spirit and body, we commit to a plan of salvation—our relationship to God and with other human beings extended over both human and divine time—that is intimately tied to the experiences we have as mortals. When we prayerfully partake of the sacrament or go to the temple, we witness to God, ourselves, and our church community that we commit to them with our whole souls. </p>

                    Baptism does not itself supernaturally effect a remission of sins; it dramatically embodies a moment of profound commitment and catalyzes the repentance process that precedes and accompanies it.

                    For many adult converts, baptism represents a clean slate, a fresh beginning. These are beautiful and important feelings, but the clean slate is a very limited metaphor for baptism . . . . Through baptism and the relationships it engenders we become clean in the ultimate sense of being Christlike. . . . The paradox of a blood capable of purification should be our first clue that we are not talking about something as simple as an eraser and a slate. . . . Baptism, as our entry into Christ’s body and his salvation, changes the very calculus of righteousness. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    A baptism of death and rebirth anticipates our own death in union with Christ. This is the marvelous image of rebirth, of dying with Christ to be resurrected with him. Buried within a liquid tomb, we die and leave behind a world without Christ. Then the water breaks, and we are born as new creatures who belong to Christ. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Baptism as adoption helps to clarify what it means that this ordinance happens once in our lives. The fact that baptism occurs once represents our earnest hope that a relationship—the relationship between us and Christ—is our salvation. . . . What God wants from me is my sonhood or daughterhood. Baptism is the physical representation of that ongoing relationship. It’s not an eraser intermittently wiping a slate clean but a birth certificate announcing: these are my parents, and I am their child. </p>

                    Baptism symbolizes the covenant by which people promise to come into the fold of God, to take upon themselves the name of Christ, to stand as a witness for God, to keep his commandments, and to bear one another’s burdens, manifesting a determination to serve him to the end, and to prepare to receive the spirit of Christ fo the remission of sins. The Lord, as his part of the covenant, is to pour out his spirit upon them, redeem them from their sins, raise them in the first resurrection, and give them eternal life.

                    <br><br>

                    The rich symbolism of the ordinance invites candidates and observers to reflect on its meanings. Burial in the water and arising out of the water symbolize the candidate’s faith in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as well as the future resurrection of all people. It also represents the candidate’s new birth to a life in Christ, being born of God, thus born again of the water and of the spirit. </p>

                    We became metaphorically married to the Messiah when we entered the waters of baptism and made a covenant with him, a ceremony which greatly parallels a wedding. We were dressed in white, there were witnesses, vows of faithfulness, a ceremony done by authority, and giving of gifts. We even took a new name upon us. Jesus was and is the Bridegroom, and all of us collectively as his baptismal disciples are his bride.


                    <br><br>
                    If we understand the nature of this covenant marriage relationship with the Lord we should inherently understand what this covenant connection provides. Like any marriage, when we covenant with Jesus we become an heir with him and attain access to all his gifts, powers, abilities, and virtues. His goodness becomes our goodness, his purity our purity, his holiness our holiness. This is because “in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest . . . unto men in the flesh." Jesus freely and willingly gives these gifts to his disciples---and many more, including his continual gift of cleansing. The key to our receiving these gifts is our covenant relationship with him. Without the covenant, there is not full access to his full gifts. With the covenant, they are freely, frequently, and fully given to his faithful family. </p>

                    Some might ask: “How does the physical ordinance of baptism help me keep my commitments to serve God? After all, is not the critical element in the salvation process the change of heart, as evidenced by my personal commitment, not my participation in some temporal ordinance?” But God knows there are no sharp dividing lines between the spiritual and physical being. In many ways their respective worlds are intertwined. Participation in an external act can be a means of strengthening and cementing an internal commitment. For example, many put their hand over their heart and pledge allegiance to their flag and country as a sign of respect and devotion. In such a case this physical act has the power to solidify and strengthen our inner commitments because it both reminds us and prompts us to reflect more meaningfully upon them.

                    <br><br>

                    For similar reasons, the physical ordinance of baptism is not just evidence of our inward commitment; it is an integral part of that commitment. The underlying symbolism expresses our resolve to be a new person in Christ. Baptism becomes our irrevocable commitment, our binding signature on the heavenly contract from which there is no retreat.


                    <br><br>
                    In a sense, baptism is God’s line in the sand. Once we cross it, there is no vacillating, no wavering, no going back without adverse eternal consequences. But if we do not cross it, we can never claim we made the commitment in the manner and at the level God requires. </p>

                    It is important to remember that baptism by immersion is for the remission of sins, not for the sanctification from sinfulness. Baptism, as with other ordinances, is a justification event. This is very important to understand when we baptize our youngsters or investigators. Some who join the Church after having felt the intense and wonderful feelings of the Spirit become discouraged when the novelty of conversion "wears off" and they settle into "real" Church life. They may feel they have fallen from grace---from sanctification. This is simply not true. It is important to help them appreciate the wonderful justification event they have just experienced and to realize that the lifelong process of sanctification still looms ahead. </p>

                    To comprehend more fully the process whereby we may obtain and always retain a remission of our sins, we need first to understand the inseparable relationship among three sacred ordinances that provide access to the powers of heaven: baptism by immersion, laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the sacrament.
                    <br><br>


                    Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins is the introductory ordinance of the gospel of Jesus Christ and must be preceded by faith in the Savior and by sincere repentance. This ordinance is a sign and a commandment which God has set for His children to enter into His kingdom. Baptism is administered in the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood. In the process of coming unto the Savior and spiritual rebirth, baptism provides a necessary initial cleansing of our souls from sin.
                    <br><br>


                    The baptismal covenant includes three fundamental commitments: (1) to be willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, (2) to always remember Him, and (3) to keep His commandments. The promised blessing for honoring this covenant is that we may always have his Spirit to be with us. Thus, baptism is the essential preparation to receive the authorized opportunity for the constant companionship of the third member of the Godhead. . .


                    <br><br>
                    Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost is an ordinance administered in the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood. In the process of coming unto the Savior and spiritual rebirth, receiving the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost in our lives creates the possibility of an ongoing cleansing of our soul from sin. This joyous blessing is vital because no unclean thing can dwell with God. As members of the Lord’s restored Church, we are blessed both by our initial cleansing from sin associated with baptism and by the potential for an ongoing cleansing from sin made possible through the companionship and power of the Holy Ghost—even the third member of the Godhead. . .

                    <br><br>

                    The sacrament is the third ordinance necessary to obtain access to the power of godliness. . . . Please consider that the emblems of the Lord’s body and blood, the bread and the water, are both blessed and sanctified. . . . To sanctify is to make pure and holy. The sacramental emblems are sanctified in remembrance of Christ’s purity, of our total dependence upon His Atonement, and of our responsibility to so honor our ordinances and covenants that we can stand spotless before Him at the last day. The ordinance of the sacrament is a holy and repeated invitation to repent sincerely and to be renewed spiritually. The act of partaking of the sacrament, in and of itself, does not remit sins. But as we prepare conscientiously and participate in this holy ordinance with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, then the promise is that we may always have the Spirit of the Lord to be with us. And by the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost as our constant companion, we can always retain a remission of our sins . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Sometimes Latter-day Saints express the wish that they could be baptized again—and thereby become as clean and worthy as the day on which they received their first saving gospel ordinance. May I respectfully suggest that our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son do not intend for us to experience such a feeling of spiritual renewal, refreshment, and restoration just once in our lives. The blessings of obtaining and always retaining a remission of our sins through gospel ordinances help us understand that baptism is a point of departure in our mortal spiritual journey; it is not a destination we should yearn to revisit over and over again.
                    <br><br>


                    The ordinances of baptism by immersion, the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the sacrament are not isolated and discrete events; rather, they are elements in an interrelated and additive pattern of redemptive progress. Each successive ordinance elevates and enlarges our spiritual purpose, desire, and performance. The Father’s plan, the Savior’s Atonement, and the ordinances of the gospel provide the grace we need to press forward and progress line upon line and precept upon precept toward our eternal destiny. </p>

                    To eat His flesh and drink His blood is a striking way of expressing how completely we must bring the Savior into our life---into our very being---that we may be one. How does this happen? First, we understand that in sacrificing His flesh and blood, Jesus atoned for our sins and overcame death, both physical and spiritual. Clearly, then, we partake of His flesh and drink His blood when we receive from Him the power and blessings of His Atonement. . . .

                    The symbolism of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper is beautiful to contemplate. The bread and water represent the flesh and blood of Him who is the Bread of Life and the Living Water, poignantly reminding us of the price He paid to redeem us. . . . We all have different sins to repent of. We all have different needs to be strengthened through the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, whom we remember in this ordinance. </p>

                    Many of us have heard the idea that the weekly sacrament functions as a rebaptism—that each time we consume those tokens of Christ’s self-sacrificing love, we are cleansed anew by our baptismal covenants. There is truth in that notion, but there are risks that go along with this particular way of thinking. This is essentially the ablution model of baptism, whereby uncleanness is washed away; it is the story of the eraser and the slate. This interpretation risks misunderstanding just how Christ helps us toward salvation. Is God keeping a scorecard? Or are we reaffirming our participation in the miracle of the atonement, our status as his children in salvation? </p>

                    There are three things fundamentally important associated with the administration of the sacrament. The first is self- discernment. It is introspection. “This do in remembrance of me,” but we should partake worthily, each one examining himself with respect to his worthiness.

                    <br><br>

                    Secondly, there is a covenant made; a covenant even more than a promise. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Thirdly, there is another blessing, and that is a sense of close relationship with the Lord. There is an opportunity to commune with oneself and to commune with the Lord. </p>

                    The most inclusive attendant blessing of the sacrament is the Spirit. The gifts and fruits of the Spirit engulf all our deepest needs: insight, flashes of guidance, energy—all the virtues that center in Christ, and through them all the fire that purifies our feelings and our aspirations.

                    <br><br>

                    So, yes, we come to renew covenants. But we also come to be renewed—renewed with a divine infusion.

                    In the context of a proper Sabbath, the sacrament draws us to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and its sanctifying power. It reconnects us to and reinforces all our covenants with God. It refreshes and reinforces all of them and it renews the promise of the companionship of the Holy Spirit always to be with us. </p>

                    In sacred sacrament moments can we really promise to never again make a mistake? Not when we know full well we will be back again the very next week needing the sacrament as much as ever. Rather, we show we are willing to take upon ourselves His name, willing to always remember Him, and willing to keep His commandments. As we renew covenants, we are committing not to be perfect like Christ immediately but to be perfected in Christ over time. . . . Enduring to the end doesn’t seem so overwhelming when we break decades and years into smaller measurements and just take life one week at a time. The sacrament is our most continuous catalyst to enduring. </p>

                    We do things for which we are sorry and desire to be forgiven, or we have erred against someone and given injury. If there is a feeling in our hearts that we are sorry for what we have done, if there is a feeling in our souls that we would like to be forgiven, then the method to obtain forgiveness is not through rebaptism, but it is to repent of our sins. . . and then repair to the sacrament table where, if we have sincerely repented and put ourselves in proper condition, we shall be forgiven, and spiritual healing will come to our souls. . . . I am a witness that there is a spirit attending the administration of the sacrament that warms the soul from head to foot; you feel the wounds of the spirit being healed and the load being lifted. Comfort and happiness come to the soul that is worthy and truly desirous of partaking of this spiritual food. </p>

                    I suggest that perhaps some of us are ashamed to come to the sacrament table because we feel unworthy and are afraid lest we eat and drink of these sacred emblems to our own condemnation. And so we want every Latter-day Saint to come to the sacrament table because it is the place for self-investigation, for self-inspection, where we may learn to rectify our course and to make right our own lives, bringing them in harmony with the teachings of the Church and with our brethren and sisters. . . . No man goes away from this Church and becomes an apostate in a week or in a month. It is a slow process. The one thing that would make for the safety of every man and woman would be to face the sacrament table every Sabbath day. We would not get very far away in one week, so far away but what perhaps by this process of self- investigation, rectifying the wrongs we have done, they may be corrected in the beginning. </p>

                    The endowment, like all blessings of membership in the Church, is not forced on anyone. Going on a mission is a choice. Serving in a calling is a choice. Paying tithing is a choice. Those who make these choices are usually grateful they did, but no one is forced. Those who receive their own endowments and then return to the temple to participate in vicarious work for the departed are always given the opportunity to opt out. At the beginning of each session there is a moment indicated in which participants can leave if they are unworthy or unwilling to assume the responsibilities associated with the blessings. I've never seen anyone leave---at least not physically---but it is all too easy to leave mentally. When I attend a session and come to that moment of silence, I try to use it as a reminder to consciously choose to stay, to pay attention, to focus, to actively engage in the experience. When I do, I always find deeper meaning. </p>

                    I invite the members of the Church to establish the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of their membership and the supernal setting for their most sacred covenants. It would be the deepest desire of my heart to have every member of the Church be temple worthy. I would hope that every adult member would be worthy of—and carry—a current temple recommend, even if proximity to a temple does not allow immediate or frequent use of it.

                    Let us be a temple-attending and a temple-loving people. Let us hasten to the temple as frequently as time and means and personal circumstances allow. Let us go not only for our kindred dead, but let us also go for the personal blessing of temple worship, for the sanctity which is provided within those hallowed and consecrated walls. The temple is a place of beauty, it is a place of revelation, it is a place of peace. It is the house of the Lord. It is holy unto the Lord. It should be holy unto us. </p>

                    When members of the Church are troubled or when crucial decisions weigh heavily upon their minds, it is a common thing for them to go to the temple. It is a good place to take our cares. In the temple we can receive spiritual perspective. There, during the time of the temple service, we are "out of the world."

                    <br><br>

                    Sometimes our minds are so beset with problems, and there are so many things clamoring for attention at once that we just cannot think clearly and see clearly. At the temple the dust of distraction seems to settle out, the fog and the haze seem to lift, and we can "see" things that we were not able to see before and find a way through our troubles that we had not previously known. </p>

                    Relationships are what matter most in life and in the afterlife, as the temple ordinances suggest. . . . This is the great secret of temple sealing—loving relationships are more important than raw immortality. In other words, salvation isn’t about single individuals, it is about families and communities. . . . According to temple theology, being bound to heaven means being bound to other people. Belonging to heaven means belonging to other people. . . . Heaven is about the family of Christ. </p>

                    Family members bear the family name: by it they are known and called and identified; it sets them apart from all those of a different lineage and ancestry. Adopted children take upon themselves the name of their newfound parents and become in all respects as though they had been born in the family. And so it is that the children of Christ, those who are born again, those who are spiritually begotten by their new Father, take upon themselves the name of Christ. By it they are known; in it they are called; it identifies and sets them apart from all others. They are now family members, Christians in the real and true sense of the word. </p>

                    As men pursue the goal of eternal life, they first enter in at the gate of repentance and baptism, thereby taking upon themselves the name of Christ. They then gain power to become his sons and daughters, to be adopted into his family, to be brethren and sisters in his kingdom. Baptism standing alone does not transform them into family members, but it opens the door to such a blessed relationship; and if men so live as to obtain the Spirit and are in fact born again, then they become members of the Holy Family.
                    <br><br>


                    Then, if they press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, keeping the commandments and living by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God, they qualify for celestial marriage, and this gives them power to become the sons of God, meaning the Father. They thus become joint-heirs with Christ who is his natural heir. Those who are sons of God in this sense are the ones who become gods in the world to come. They have exaltation and godhood because the family unit continues in eternity. Celestial marriage standing alone does not transform them into sons of God and make them joint- heirs with Christ, but it opens the door to this greatest of all blessings; and if those involved keep their covenants, they are assured of receiving the promised inheritance. Through Christ and his atoning sacrifice they “are begotten sons and daughters unto God,” meaning the Father. “And all those who are begotten through me,” Christ says, “are partakers” of his glory. </p>

                    The honorable men and women of the earth are saved in a kingdom of glory but are not in the Father’s presence: not because they do not “deserve” it or qualify for it but because, given the opportunity, they did not create that relationship. . . .


                    <br><br>
                    The complaint that ordinances of salvation are arbitrary misses the point. They are arbitrary in order to fulfill their purpose. . . . In this light and context, the seeming arbitrariness of gospel ordinances becomes the very ground on which the particularism of a specific, personal relationship with the Divine becomes enacted. Ordinances make possible our response to God’s invitation. We are enabled to formalize and constitute a living, dynamic relationship through a set of ritual performances. We willfully and bodily participate in the forging of that relationship as a response to a personal beckoning rather than an impersonal moral imperative. Through baptism, we formally and publicly accept Christ’s invitation to be our spiritual Father. We thus signal our desire to be adopted into His family. Through the endowment, we affirm our commitment to bind ourselves more closely to Him through progressively greater demonstrations of our love and fidelity. And in our own temple sealing, we signify our willingness to expand the intimate association with the Divine, both laterally through marriage and vertically through posterity.
                    <br><br>


                    From another angle, what at times could appear empty legalism might in a broader context be seen as an alternative to the well- intentioned but disastrous illusion of an ungrounded human autonomy. The ordinances—like the structures of organized religion themselves—provide an unchanging framework giving continuity to our relationship to the Divine. </p>

                    A covenant denotes an agreement between persons or nations; more often between God and man; but in this latter case it is important to notice that the two parties to the agreement do not stand in the relation of independent and equal contractors. God in his good pleasure fixes the terms, which man accepts.

                    Covenants are initiated by God. The particulars of the covenant are specified by God. The Almighty sets the terms and conditions. And while a covenant is a spiritual arrangement intended to establish expectations and foster resolve and dedication on the part of mortals, it is far more than a transaction between the two parties. A covenant, in the gospel sense, is one of the means by which our infinite and eternal Father in Heaven links himself with his children.
                    <br><br>


                    Covenants bind the participants together. Covenants are thus more about relationship than the realization of an end, even a righteous end. The making and keeping of sacred covenants is all about linking an individual and a people to the Father and the Son. </p>

                    A covenant is an agreement between God and man, an accord whose terms are set by God. In these divine agreements, God binds Himself to sustain, sanctify, and exalt us in return for our commitment to serve Him and keep His commandments.

                    Christ’s gift to us is the power to repent and change. Our access to that power is through our covenants with Him. . . . We enter into covenants by priesthood ordinances, sacred rituals that God has ordained for us to manifest our commitment.

                    The gospel is in fact a covenant—a two-way promise. The Lord agrees to do for us what we could never do for ourselves—forgive our sins, lift our burdens, renew our souls and re-create our nature, raise us from the dead, and qualify us for glory hereafter. At the same time, we promise to do what we can do: receive the ordinances of salvation, love and serve one another, and do all in our power to put off the natural man and deny ourselves of ungodliness. We believe that more is required of us than a verbal expression of faith in the Lord, more than a confession with the lips that we have received Christ into our hearts. We know, without question, that the power to save us, to change us, to renew our souls, is in Christ. . .
                    <br><br>


                    Good works evidence our faith, our desire to remain in covenant with Christ. But these good works, though necessary to our salvation, are not sufficient to save us. Few things would be more sinister than encouraging lip service to God but discouraging actions of obedience and faithful discipleship. On the other hand, surely nothing could be more offensive to God than the smug self-assurance that comes from trusting in one’s own works or relying upon one’s own strength. . .


                    <br><br>
                    Then what is the place of good works? The works and deeds of man, though insufficient of themselves for salvation, are necessary. They are necessary because they evidence our desire to keep our covenant, to be true to our promise to follow the Lord and keep his commandments. True faith always results in faithfulness. Discipleship is inextricably linked with full acceptance of Christ and his gospel. </p>

                    Salvation comes through a covenant relationship in which both faith and works play their parts. To insist that salvation comes by works alone, that we can earn it ourselves without needing the grace of God, insults the mercy of God and mocks the sacrifice of Jesus Christ in our behalf. On the other hand, to insist that salvation comes by belief alone and that God places no other obligations upon the believer insults the justice of God and makes Christ the minister of sin.
                    <br><br>


                    The scriptural concept of the covenant, an agreement between mortals and God that lays obligations on both parties and that satisfies both justice and mercy, eliminates the false either/or of faith versus works. In simple terms this is the arrangement—we do what we are able to do, and Jesus Christ, the object of our faith, out of his love and mercy and grace, does what we are not able to do. And we must believe he can do it—we must believe Christ. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    It is true that we cannot save ourselves by our works, but we can contribute something to the joint efforts of the partnership. To be in a partnership, to be in a covenant relationship, we must do something. Even though our best efforts may be insufficient to save ourselves, they are sufficient as a token of good faith to establish a covenant with our Savior. Though that covenant relationship is then “sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify,” God still requires our participation. Without our assent and our participation, salvation would amount to nothing more than predestination, a happy accident that arbitrarily happens to some people and not to others. </p>

Heaven is not reached by supplementing, but by covenanting; not by defining a ratio, but by building a relationship; not by negotiation, but by cooperation and union.

Though we may see our part in the matter of faithfulness going by fits and starts, bumps and bursts, our progress erratic at best, God’s part is sure and steady and supreme.
