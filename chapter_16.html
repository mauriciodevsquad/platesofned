                    It isn’t as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don’t worry. I say that to myself every morning. It will all work out. Put your trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the future. The Lord will not forsake us. If we will put our trust in Him, if we will pray to Him, if we will live worthy of His blessings, He will hear our prayers. </p>

                    In my ninety-plus years, I have learned a secret. I have learned that when good men and good women face challenges with optimism, things will always work out!

                    The sense in which a Christian leaves it to God is that he puts all his trust in Christ: Trusts that Christ will somehow share with him the perfect human obedience which He carried out from His birth to His crucifixion; that Christ will make the man more like Himself and, in a sense make good his deficiencies. . . . Handing everything over to Christ does not, of course, mean that you stop trying. To trust Him means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. </p>

                    The ability to turn everything into something good appears to be a godly characteristic. Our Heavenly Father always seems able to do this. Everything, no matter how dire, becomes a victory to the Lord. Joseph [of Egypt], although a slave and wholly undeserving of his fate, nevertheless remained faithful to the Lord and continued to live the commandments and made something very good of his degrading circumstances. People like this cannot be defeated, because they will not give up. They have the correct, positive attitude, and Dale Carnegie's expression seems to apply: If you feel you have a lemon, you can either complain about how sour it is, or you can make a lemonade. It is all up to you. </p>

                    Some of you may at times have cried out in your suffering, wondering why our Heavenly Father would allow you to go through whatever trials you are facing.

                    <br><br>

                    Our mortal life, however, was never meant to be easy or consistently pleasant. Our Heavenly Father . . . knows that we learn and grow and become refined through hard challenges, heartbreaking sorrows, and difficult choices. Each one of us experiences dark days when our loved ones pass away, painful times when our health is lost, feelings of being forsaken when those we love seem to have abandoned us. These and other trials present us with the real test of our ability to endure. </p>

                    There is no way around it---life is not fair. Each day, through no fault of their own, people are falsely accused, oppressed, hurt, or abused by others. some are cruelly robbed of things they hold dear: their good name, loved ones, financial security, mental and physical abilities. Yet others are denied opportunities they long for and deserve: freedom, education, health, family, marriage, and children. Since the Fall of Adam and Eve the world's equity meter has been thrown off-kilter---and is completely broken for some. In his goodness, however, God sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to make at-one-ment for his children to bring things into harmony---an offering of rebalancing, restitution, recompense, and restoration. Jesus's divine gift not only restores purity to the sinner and life to the dead, but also restores capacity to the incapacitated, love to the lonely, family to the solitary, and opportunity to the oppressed. Whether in this life or the next, Jesus will fully restore and then some. This recompensing reality enables Christ's followers to freely forgive, bear suffering with patience, be confidently meek, and enjoy the assurance of hope.

                    Jesus came to redeem men from all the effects of the Fall of Adam and Eve. Although the Fall was necessary for God's purposes, paradise was lost. Murders were committed. Sin became common among men. Innocents suffered. The wicked prospered. Healthy cells metastasized. Families fractured. The quiet, balanced harmony in Eden shattered. Therefore, God offered to make things right---he offered atonement through his Son. . . . Whether in this life or the next Christ will repay, reinstate, renew, refresh, or return any blessing that was lost, denied, or taken in this life. he will perfectly restore, rectify, redeem, and recompense any injustice or undue suffering that was a result of our mortal experience.


                    <br><br>
                    Christ's power or restoration says,"If you didn't have the opportunity to be married in this life, you will eventually. If you couldn't bear children, you'll be given that blessing. If you lost a child to an untimely death, you'll have them back and raise them. If you've been denied a physical capacity, you'll one day regain it. If you've never had the opportunity to hear the gospel in this life you'll be given that in full." </p>

                    Because of mortality and human agency, sometimes God won't change circumstances to relieve a burden. When God can't or won't change an external circumstance, however, he can and will change our internal workings to successfully meet the challenge, if we let him. He often does this by making our burdens feel lighter through divine spiritual gifts that expand our perspective, empower our understanding, alter our attitude, and provide patience, comfort, and peace. </p>

                    Many Christians, and many Latter-day Saints in particular, have been witness to the divine healing power of Christ in their lives or the lives of loved ones. Jesus, as the scriptures repeatedly attest, is the Great Physician, the Master Healer. There seems to be no malady that Christ cannot cure, and he continues to do so for many today. However, irrespective of personal righteousness and in spite of faithful prayers and blessings, many of us continue to suffer from physical or mental disabilities and pains. We believe and we have faith, yet the problems persist: the tumor remains, the slipped disc causes continual pain, infertility endures, and fatigue remains chronic. What then? What does the healing power of Christ offer when we aren't cured? Although mortal conditions may continue to plague us, Christ's promise of internal peace can remain regardless of external conditions. His offer to ease our burdens can be experienced today even if the burden remains. He heals even when there is no miracle cure. </p>

                    The Lord will heal according to the persons' faith and the Father's will, but as we become more mature in our Christianity we become less demanding of an automatic fix. We gain better perspective about why sometimes bodily healing isn't granted. We understand that disease and death---including untimely occurrences---are a necessary part of God's work and glory, and to heal every hurt upon every asking would counteract the eternal purposes of God. . . . Sometimes physical healings don't happen because there is something to learn from the suffering or the death of a loved one. Sometimes these infirmities give us a purer and deeper faith, a faith that is in Jesus Christ and is not dependent on outcomes. </p>

                    Let me first distinguish between healing and cure. Cure returns us to our previous state of wellness, which is usually what we long for. But the scriptures never speak of the gift of cure. They speak of the gift of healing. Healing is a different process from cure. Healing involves a spiritual and emotional reweaving of our life story to incorporate, not merely remove, our injuries. It involves growth and personal change, maturation into a new state of deeper trust in God despite, not in the absence of, suffering. Thus, in spite of uncured physical difficulties we can yet experience the miracle of healing. </p>

                    Inner healing comes to us through God providing miraculous spiritual gifts such as increased patience, understanding, strength, empathy, and love. In the midst of our sufferings God touches our hearts and applies the balm of Gilead to what's festering inside despite our circumstances on the outside. These spiritual gifts penetrate deep into the tissues of our wounded soul and enable a healing through oneness with God.

                    <br><br>

                    One word the scriptures use often to describe this type of internal, spiritual healing is the word wholeness. Wholeness is a unity between body, mind, spirit, and God. . . . The world can sometimes give us cures, but Christ can always give us wholeness. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    Most often you can't be cured just by trying harder. But you can be made whole by being softer. Remember that your progress is not measured in the doing but in the becoming. Not in release from pain, but in accepting His will. Not in being more physically capable as others are, but in being more spiritually sensitive as the Lord is. </p>

                    So often in life a deserved blessing is quickly followed by a needed stretching. Spiritual exhilaration may be quickly followed by a vexation or temptation. Were it otherwise, extended spiritual reveries or immunities from adversity might induce in us a regrettable forgetfulness of others in deep need. The sharp, side-by-side contrast of the sweet and the bitter is essential until the very end of this brief, mortal experience. </p>

                    Although one might be holding to the iron rod and safety walking the straight and narrow path, sin is only a step away. The same is true with any form of bitterness, whether through sin or natural trials and adversity---there always seems to be a divine deference that allows joy and misery to incessantly be on the heals of each other. </p>

                    Now, we find many people critical when a righteous person is killed, a young father or mother is taken from a family, or when violent deaths occur. Some become bitter when oft-repeated prayers seem unanswered. Some lose faith and turn sour when solemn administrations by holy men seem to be ignored and no restoration seems to come from repeated prayer circles. But if all the sick were healed, if all the righteous were protected and the wicked destroyed, the whole program of the Father would be annulled and the basic principle of the gospel, free agency, would be ended.
                    <br><br>


                    If pain and sorrow and total punishment immediately followed the doing of evil, no soul would repeat a misdeed. If joy and peace and rewards were instantaneously given the doer of good, there could be no evil---all would do good and not because of the rightness of doing good. There would be no test of strength, no development of character, no growth of powers, no free agency, no Satanic controls.

                    <br><br>

                    Should all prayers be immediately answered according to our selfish desires and our limited understanding, then there would be little or no suffering, sorrow, disappointment, or even death; and if these were not, there would also be an absence of joy, success, resurrection, eternal life, and godhood. </p>

                    We might think of the degree of our personal fault for the bad things that happen in our lives as a continuum ranging from sin to adversity, with the degree of our fault dropping from high at one end of the spectrum to zero at the other. At the "sin" end of the continuum, we bear grave responsibility, for we bring the bitter fruits of sin fully upon ourselves. But at the other end of the spectrum, marked by "adversity," we may bear no responsibility at all. The bitterness of adversity may come to us, as it did to Job in the Old Testament, regardless of our actual, conscious fault.
                    <br><br>


                    Along this fault-level continuum, between the poles of sin and adversity, lie such intermediate points as unwise choices and hasty judgments. In these cases, it may be unclear just how much personal fault we bear for the bitter fruits we may taste or cause others to taste. Bitterness may taste the same, whatever its source, and it can destroy our peace, break our hearts, and separate us from God. Could it be that the great "at-one-ment" of Christ could put back together the broken parts and give beauty to the ashes of experience such as this? I believe that it does, because tasting the bitter in all its forms is a deliberate part of the great plan of life. </p>

                    Some worry endlessly over missions that were missed, or marriages that did not turn out, or babies that did not arrive, or children that seem lost, or dreams unfulfilled, or because age limits what they can do.

                    We can feel joy even while having a bad day, a bad week, or even a bad year! The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. When the focus of our lives is on God’s plan of salvation, and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening—or not happening—in our lives.

                    To all who believe in a living, personal God and His divine Truth, life can be so delightful and beautiful. As a matter of fact, it’s glorious just to be alive. Joy, even ecstasy, can be experienced in the consciousness of existence. There is supreme satisfaction in sensing one’s individual entity, and in realizing that that entity is part of God’s great creative plan. There are none so poor, none so rich, sick or maimed who may not be conscious of this relationship. </p>

                    I have come to realize that joy is a journey and not a destination. Joy is a choice, not an accident waiting to happen. Joy is a decision we can make at any time and in any situation. Happiness is an emotion that comes and goes. It’s a reaction to external events. Joy, is a state of mind that comes from within and can be eternal. </p>

                    Our spiritual survival depends on seeing each day as a set of possibilities for doing good, not an endless set of ways to fall short. For all of us, realizing that there is no way to do everything, especially all at once, is a simultaneously freeing and stretching stroke of insight. If I could do only one thing well today, what should it be?

                    If we looked at mortality as the whole of existence, then pain, sorrow, failure and short life would be a calamity. But if we look upon life as an eternal thing stretching far in the pre-mortal past and on into the eternal post-death future, then all happenings may be put in proper perspective. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    I am positive in my mind that the Lord has planned our destiny. Sometime we’ll understand fully, and when we see back from the vantage point of the future, we shall be satisfied with many of the happenings of this life that are so difficult for us to comprehend. </p>

                    Our spiritual journey is the process of a lifetime. We do not know everything in the beginning or even along the way. Our conversion comes step-by-step, line upon line. We first build a foundation of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We treasure the principles and ordinances of repentance, baptism, and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. We include a continuing commitment to prayer, a willingness to be obedient, and an ongoing witness of the Book of Mormon. . .

                    <br><br>

                    We then remain steady and patient as we progress through mortality. At times, the Lord’s answer will be, “You don’t know everything, but you know enough”—enough to keep the commandments and to do what is right. . .
                    <br><br>


                    We each have moments of spiritual power, moments of inspiration and revelation. We must sink them deep into the chambers of our souls. As we do, we prepare our spiritual home storage for moments of personal difficulty. .


                    <br><br>
                    Challenges, difficulties, questions, doubts—these are part of our mortality. But we are not alone. As disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, we have enormous spiritual reservoirs of light and truth available to us. Fear and faith cannot coexist in our hearts at the same time. In our days of difficulty, we choose the road of faith. Jesus said, “Be not afraid, only believe.” </p>

                    Where is God when it hurts? He is in his heavens. He is aware. He knows. In ways that we cannot even comprehend, He knows. And he blesses and lifts and liberates and lightens the burdens of his children whenever he can. But he cannot remove us from the toils and tragedies and contradictions of life without robbing us of moral experience. These things come with the turf. They are part of the test. So much depends on how we choose to look upon what most consider to be the unfairness and the senseless nature of temporal trauma. So much depends upon what we understand about God our Father, about his plan of salvation, and about how vital it is for us to move ahead, even when our burdens of others seem unbearable. . . . When we tear ourselves free from the entanglements of the world, are we promised a religion of repose or an Eden of ease? No! We are promised tears and trials and toil! But we are also promised final triumph, the mere contemplation of which tingles the soul.

                    Every one of us will, at one time or another, face adversity, whether it be in the form of financial reversals, personal struggles, the loss of a loved one, or some type of profound disappointment. Adversity will come to us, one and all, whether we are prepared for it or not. Too often in tough times we yield ourselves to stress and distress, to despondency and discouragement, much more so than our forebearers would have. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    At the same time, it seems to me that there is a mind-set, characteristic of our day, that opens us to despair. That mind-set is one in which we assume, given all the pleasures and luxuries of our day and age, that all should be well with us, that we should be perpetually happy. Many of us have bought into and imbibed the jargon and the philosophy of our pop psychology world. The fact is, life can be tough. We are not guaranteed a stress-free existence, nor did the Lord promise us a mortal life void of challenge and difficulty. . . . We receive our joys alongside our sorrows. Both elements of the equation come with the turf, with earth. And we knew this before we came. </p>

                    Spiritual strength is like a muscle; it will grow only when it is repeatedly stretched to its outer limits. Were it otherwise, in our pre-earth life our Father could have simply given us enough grace and strength to perfect us instantly, thus skipping the terrible risks and travails of life on earth. But in such a bypass, we would miss out on the experience necessary to comprehend and assimilate the very nature of joy. Without sorrow and opposition, there is no growth. And without growth, there can be no joy.

                    No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude, and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God. . . and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we came here to acquire and which will make us more like Father and Mother in heaven. </p>

                    If good acts were immediately rewarded and bad immediately punished, we could calculate consequences with considerable ease. Where then would be the test? The test of life is often that the righteous, apparently, suffer; and the wicked, apparently, prosper. Living the good life poses extreme difficulties. If we do it anyway, we are on the right way.

                    In short, there are great lessons to be learned from life’s struggles, lessons that can perhaps be acquired in no other way. Many of our afflictions we bring upon ourselves through our own impatience, short-sightedness, or sins. There are even lessons to be learned from our sins—not the least of which is the motivation to avoid in the future the pain associated with our misdeeds. There are, however, lessons that come to us from God through challenges and distresses and setbacks and failures. There is a purifying work of pain, a divine work that can transform the soul of the distressed one, if he or she approaches the difficulty with the proper attitude. It is not uncommon for persons who have lost a loved one, or who now must face the prospect of a terminal disease, or whose financial fortunes have been dramatically reversed, to ask: “Why? Why would God do this to me? Why is this happening?” These are of course natural reactions to trauma, especially when each one of us would be perfectly content to remain perfectly content! But that’s not why we are here. </p>

                    The dial on the wheel of sorrow eventually points to each of us. At one time or another, everyone must experience sorrow. No one is exempt. The Lord in His wisdom does not shield anyone from grief or sadness.

                    Who knows how a current trial may be a solution to something yet unseen? Everything in the mortal probation, no matter how bad or how good it seems, is a tangle of advantage and disadvantage. How often, for example, we are elated over an apparent windfall, only to find soon that it is turning sour in some way; or we fall into depression over a trial that with time produces an unexpected benefit. </p>

                    Once we leave the beauty of the garden and enter the lone and dreary world, we sometimes make the mistake of resenting our fallen condition and yearn to return to the garden. The answer, of course, is to move forward from the Garden of Eden to the Garden of Gethsemane and experience the blessings made possible through the atonement of Jesus Christ.

                    Pain and suffering came upon all as a result of the Fall, and it is a “given” in the mortal phase of our eternal lives. We knew that pain would be part of the plan. Just as Adam and Eve chose, so we chose to accept sorrow, hardship, death, and pain. We knew that those negative experiences are not in the plan capriciously or without larger purpose. Pain is a necessary part of how we come to differentiate the good from the evil. It helps us learn what is true and real and good, through our experiences in dealing with the “opposition in all things” that Father Lehi spoke about. Pain provides us with the opportunity for spiritual growth. It helps us attain humility, and it helps us realize our complete dependence on God. While we may not seek or want pain, we must learn to appreciate its presence in our lives and the important role it plays in our personal eternal progression. </p>

                    A man’s mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or neglected, it must, and will, bring forth. If no useful seeds are put into it, then an abundance of useless weed- seeds will fall therein, and will continue to produce their kind.

                    <br><br>

                    Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts. By pursuing this process, a man sooner or later discovers that he is the master gardener of his soul, the director of his life. He also reveals, within himself, the laws of thought, and understands with ever-increasing accuracy, how the thought-forces and mind-elements operate in the shaping of his character, circumstances, and destiny.

                    Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself, the shaper and author of environment. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Let a man radically alter his thoughts, and he will be astonished at the rapid transformation it will effect in the material conditions of his life. Men imagine that thought can be kept secret, but it cannot; it rapidly crystallizes into habit, andhabit solidifies into circumstance. . . .

                    A particular train of thought persisted in, be it good or bad, cannot fail to produce its results on the character and circumstances. A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances. </p>

                    Now there is a veil between us and our Father, and we are left to ourselves, to a certain extent. We are left to be governed by the influences that we invite, and there are any number of evil influences around us, whispering into our ears and hearts all manner of things. If we will open our hearts to receive them or allow them to enter our hearts, we will think evil of our brethren and of our sisters; we will have malice towards them; we will envy them; and we will say bad things about them. God will test us in all this.

                    The Lord is in control. He knows the end from the beginning. He has given us adequate instruction that, if followed, will see us safely through any crisis. His purposes will be fulfilled, and someday we will understand the eternal reasons for all of these events. Therefore, today we must be careful not to overreact, nor should we be caught up in extreme preparations; but what we must do is keep the commandments of God and never lose hope!

                    <br><br>

                    But where do we find hope in the midst of such turmoil and catastrophe? Quite simply, our one hope for spiritual safety during these turbulent times is to turn our minds and our hearts to Jesus Christ. . . Armed with the shield of faith, we can overcome many of our daily challenges and overpower our greatest weaknesses and fears, knowing that if we do our best to keep the commandments of God, come what may, we will be all right. </p>

                    In reality, there aren’t many things in a day that are totally without significance. Even the mundane and repetitious can be tiny, but significant building blocks that in time establish the discipline and character and order needed torealize our plans and dreams. Therefore, as you ask in prayer for your daily bread, consider thoughtfully your needs—both what you may lack and what you must protect against. As you retire to bed, think about the successes and failures of the day and what will make the next day a little better. And thank your Heavenly Father for the manna He has placed along your path that sustained you through the day.

                    Some might ask when faced with suffering, how could Almighty God let this happen? And then that seemingly inevitable question, why did this happen to me? Why must we experience disease and events that disable or call precious family members home early or extend their years in pain? Why the heartaches? At these moments we can turn to the great plan of happiness authored by a Heavenly Father. That plan, when presented in the pre-earth life, prompted us all to shout for joy. Put simply, this life is training for eternal exaltation, and that process means tests and trials. It has always been so, and no one is spared.

                    I have spent a lot of time wondering why my faith was not enough to change things. What I have come to understand is that sometimes it takes more faith to accept things as they are than it does to change them. I have also come to understand that true faith is trusting God, even when it hurts desperately, even when we don’t feel equal to what is asked of us, even when we don’t seem to receive what we live for, even when we feel so alone, even when we don’t understand. With the gospel of Jesus Christ, we do not give up, give out, or give in. We endure and we trust with faith that we will someday understand. We strive to love God as Christ did and to trust in His perfect love for us. People who struggle with challenges need to know that the battle goes on every day and must be fought with courage and honor and faith. We need to remind ourselves that God is allowing our faith to grow as we reach and stretch for Him. </p>

                    Fear can be a huge obstacle to living the gospel in the steady, serene, and sincere way it is meant to be lived. Fears ranging from fear of failure and fear of what others may think to fear of losing loved ones and fear of our own death can prevent us from internalizing and really understanding the profound peace that only the true gospel of Jesus Christ can create within us. Yet this powerful peace is our only real protection against the very things we fear. Thus, winning the battle against fear breaks this paralyzing cycle and empowers us to withstand one of Satan’s most effective and destructive tools in these last days.

                    All things working together for our good is very different from all things working together for our apparent success or excellence as measured by the standards of this world. Because his making us perfect enough to enjoy eternal life is our ultimate goal, we may need all things to work “for our good” in such a way that there are growing pains, tests, afflictions, and the purification by fire. This need for discipline may bring us experiences others would not judge to be big success stories. We may have encounters that are harsh, painful, and beyond our ability (let alone the ability of other people) to understand.

                    <br><br>

                    To develop a sufficiently independent relationship with God requires that the private world in which we dwell in communion with him transcend the other “worlds” we inhabit–the world of work, community life, friends, family, and even relationships in the Church. As we gain experience in that private and personal world, we will become less dependent upon the approval of others for our sense of personal worth. </p>

                    Enduring to the end goes beyond simple maintenance of a relationship. It means to improve and continually strengthen one’s knowledge of the Savior and one’s faithfulness by degrees, line upon line. While some have come to read “enduring to the end” as merely to “just hang in there” or “avoid major transgressions,” it clearly means to continue to grow. It begins with forsaking sin, continually repenting, and being strictly obedient. Developing Christian attributes is also required.

                    The ancient prophets speak of ‘entering into God’s rest’; what does it mean? To my mind, it means entering into the knowledge and love of God, having faith in his purpose and in his plan, to such an extent that we know we are right, and that we are not hunting for something else, we are not disturbed by every wind of doctrine, or by cunning and craftiness of men who lie in wait to deceive. We know of the doctrine that it is of God, and we do not ask any questions of anybody about it; they are welcome to their opinions, to their ideas and to their vagaries. The man who has reached that degree of faith in God that all doubt and fear have been cast from him, he has entered into ‘God’s rest’ and he need not fear the vagaries of men, nor their cunning craftiness, by which they seek to deceive and mislead him from the truth. I pray that we may all enter into God’s rest—rest from doubt, from fear, from apprehension of danger, rest from religious turmoil of the world. . .

                    <br><br>

                    The “rest of the Lord” is a deep spiritual peace the Lord bestows on those who have an invincible determination in their hearts to be steadfast in the truth, and who are treading in humility and righteousness the path of the “followers of Jesus Christ.” These people receive joy to their hearts that frees them from unsettled, restless feelings of mortal discouragement, suspicion, unrest, and uncertainty. This is not just a hope for the next life. We can receive this tangible spiritual contentment . . . here upon the earth, from this time forth, now, today . . . .
                    <br><br>

                    The rest here referred to is not physical rest, for there is no such thing as physical rest in the Church of Jesus Christ. Reference is made to the spiritual rest and peace which are born from a settled conviction of the truth in the minds of men. We may thus enter into the rest of the Lord today, by coming to an understanding of the truths of the gospel. No people is more entitled to this rest—this peace of the spirit—than are the members of the Church. </p>

                    In one sense, a person enters the rest of God in the present, in the here and now, when he or she gains a testimony of the gospel and is brought out of worldly confusion into the peace and security that comes only from God. In this sense, the rest of God is the spiritual rest and peace which are born from a settled conviction of the truth in the minds of individuals. It is to know the peace of the Spirit, to enjoy the blessing of the Comforter. It is what Jesus promised to disciples when he said: Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. </p>

                    I believe that we might well take to heart the admonition of Alma and be content with that which God hath allotted us. We might well be assured that we had something to do with our ‘allotment’ in our preexistent state. This would be an additional reason for us to accept our present condition and make the best of it. It is what we agreed to do. </p>

                    What finally dawns on us as we seek deeper into the Lord’s things is that, while daily life has to go forward with its duties on many fronts, still, even in the midst of all life’s demands, we can become imbued with the Light of Eternal Life, the sense that we are His and He is ours. This way of traveling with quickened Hope is beautiful and makes possible our dealing both fearlessly and gently with what life brings. </p>
