    When you give your heart to inviting people to come unto Christ, your heart will be changed. You will be doing His work for Him. You will find that He keeps His promise to be one with you in your service. You will come to know Him. And in time you will come to be like Him and “be perfected in Him.” By helping others come unto Him, you will find that you have come unto Him yourself. If you want to be near Him, to feel His peace, you can do it best in His service. Henry B. Eyring, “Come Unto Christ,” Ensign, March 2008, 52.


    2
    As we extend our hands and hearts toward others in Christlike love, something wonderful happens to us. Our own spirits become healed, more refined, and stronger. We become happier, more peaceful, and more receptive to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit.

    Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “You Are My Hands,” Ensign, May 2010, 75.


    3
    After a joyful reunion with the resurrected Jesus (on the shores of Galilee), Peter had an exchange with the Savior that I consider the crucial turning point of the apostolic ministry generally and certainly for Peter personally, moving this great rock of a man to a majestic life of devoted service and leadership. . .



    “Peter, why are you here? Why are we back on this same shore, by these same nets, having this same conversation? Wasn’t it obvious then and isn’t it obvious now that if I want fish, I can get fish? What I need, Peter, are disciples—and I need them forever. I need someone to feed my sheep and save my lambs. I need someone to preach my gospel and defend my faith. I need someone who loves me, truly, truly loves me, and loves what our Father in Heaven has commissioned me to do. Ours is not a feeble message. It is not a fleeting task. It is not hapless; it is not hopeless; it is not to be consigned to the ash heap of history. It is the work of Almighty God, and it is to change the world.” Jeffrey R. Holland, “The First Great Commandment,” Ensign, November 2012, 84.


    4
    In our pre-existent state, in the day of the great council, we made a certain agreement with the Almighty. The Lord proposed a plan, conceived by him. We accepted it. Since the plan is intended for all men, we become parties to the salvation of every person under the plan. We agreed, right then and there, to be not only saviors for ourselves, but . . . saviors for the whole human family. We went into partnership with the Lord. The working out of the plan became then not merely the Father’s work, and the Savior’s work, but also our work. The least of us, the humblest, is in partnership with the Almighty in achieving the purpose of the eternal plan of salvation. John A. Widstoe, Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine, Oct. 1934, 189.


    5
    Jesus had not finished his work when his body was slain, although he had accomplished the purpose for which he then came to earth, he had not fulfilled all his work. And when well he? Not until he has redeemed and saved every son and daughter of our father Adam that have been or ever will be born upon this earth to the end of time, except the sons of perdition. That is his mission. We will not finish our work until we have saved ourselves, and then not until we shall have saved all depending upon us; for we are to become saviors upon Mount Zion, as well as Christ. We are call to this mission. Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine, 442.


    6
    The more unsavory the characters, the more at ease they seem to feel around Jesus. People like these found Jesus appealing: a Samaritan social outcast, a military officer of the tyrant Herod, a quisling tax collector, a recent hostess to seven demons.



    In contrast, Jesus got a chilly response from more respectable types. Pious Pharisees thought him uncouth and worldly. A rich young ruler walked away shaking his head, and even the open-minded Nicodemus sought a meeting under the cover of darkness.



    Somehow we have created a community of respectability in the church. The down-and-out, who flocked to Jesus when he lived on earth, no longer feel welcome. How did Jesus, the only perfect person in history, manage to attract the notoriously imperfect? And what keeps us from following in his steps today? Philip Yancey, The Jesus I Never Knew, 147-148.


    7
    Jesus was deeply offended by self-righteousness, put off by pomposity, and verbally condemned those who focused more on externals than on the “weightier matters of the law,” on things that really mattered. To be sure, Jesus loved and cherished the truth and taught it; he could do not other, for he was the Truth. And yet he tended not to exclude but rather to draw his circle of inclusion far larger than the religious establishment of his day chose to do. Robert L. Millet, The Vision of Mormonism, xxi-xxii.


    8
    A sound way to neutralize the effects of sin in one's life is to bring the light of the gospel to others who do not now enjoy it. This can mean working with both inactive members of the Church and nonmembers. . . .



    Every person who is beginning the long journey of emancipating himself from the thralldom of sin and evil will find comfort in the thought expressed by James (James 5:19-20). We could expand it somewhat and remind the transgressor that every testimony he bears, every prayer he offers, every sermon he preaches, every scripture he reads, every help he gives to stimulate and raise others---all these strengthen him and raise him to higher levels. . . .



    Not all of us can engage in full-time missionary work, where one might have opportunity to explain the gospel and bear testimony of its divinity many times every day. . . . But what every member most definitely can do is follow President McKay's inspired slogan. "Every member a missionary". . . Spencer W. Kimball, The Miracle of Forgiveness, 204-206. 


    9
    There is no other labor in all the world that brings to a human heart, judging from my own personal experience, more joy, peace and serenity than proclaiming the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heber J. Grant, CR, October 1926, 4.


    10
    No person whose soul is illuminated by the burning Spirit of God can . . . remain passive. He is driven by an irresistible urge to fit himself to be an active agent of God in furthering righteousness and in freeing the lives and minds of men from the bondage of sin. Marion G. Romney, CR, October 1941.


    11
    After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the gospel. TPJS, 113. 


    12
    Every member a missionary! David O. McKay, CR, April 1959, 122.


    13
    It’s not just what you say that inspires and uplifts people, it’s how you say what you’re saying that makes the message even more powerful. Words are just words, but when you attach them to emotion, you’re really conveying a powerful message.

    Wain Myers, From Baptist Preacher to Mormon Teacher, 96.


    14
    No other success can compensate for failure in the home. David O. McKay, CR, April 1964, 5.


    15
    The most important work that you will ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home. 

    Harold B. Lee, “Maintain Your Place as a Woman,” Ensign, February 1972, 51.


    16
    Sadly, in today’s world, a person’s importance is often judged by the size of the audience before which he or she performs. That is how media and sports programs are rated, how corporate prominence is sometimes determined, and often how governmental rank is obtained. That may be why roles such as father, mother, and missionary seldom receive standing ovations. Fathers, mothers, and missionaries ‘play’ before very small audiences. Yet, in the eyes of the Lord, there may be only one size of audience that is of lasting importance—and that is just one. M. Russell Ballard, “The Atonement and the Value of One Soul,” Ensign, May 2004, 87.


    17
    The gospel takes deeper root in those who share it frequently. L. Tom Perry, “The Gospel of Jesus Christ,” Ensign, May 2008, 46. 


    18
    No joy is equal to bringing another to the light of the gospel. Ezra Taft Benson, Counsel to the Saints, May 1984, 44.


    19
    You cannot lift another soul until you are standing on higher ground than he is. You must be sure, if you would rescue the man, that you yourself are setting the example of what you would have him be. You cannot light a fire in another soul unless it is burning in your own soul. The testimony that you bear, the spirit with which you teach and with which you lead, is one of the most important assets that you can have as you try to strengthen others. Harold B. Lee, “Stand Ye in Holy Places,” Ensign, July 1973, 123.


    20
    You can teach effectively only that which you yourselves feel. David O. McKay, Gospel Ideals, 190.


    21
    There are those who wake up every morning dreading to go to school, or even to a Church activity, because they worry about how they will be treated. You have the power to change their lives for the better. . . . The Lord is counting on you to be a builder and give them a lift. Think less of yourself and more about the power you have to assist others, even those within your own family.

    Joe J. Christensen, “The Savior is Counting on You,” Ensign, November 1996, 3


    22
    Regarding one’s testimony, remember, that which one willingly shares he keeps, while that which he selfishly keeps he loses. Teach and testify. There is no better combination. Thomas S. Monson, Pathways, 100-101.


    23
    If you do not magnify your callings, God will hold you responsible for those you might have saved, had you done your duty.

    John Taylor, “Discourse,” Deseret News, Aug. 7, 1878, 2. 


    24
    Friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of ‘Mormonism.’ . . . A man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race. TPJS, 316, 174.


    25
    So long as a man believes in God and has a little faith in the Church organization, we nurture and aid that person to continue faithfully as a member of the Church though he may not believe all that is revealed. Joseph F. Smith, When Mormons Doubt, 156.


    26
    I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy as cause for withdrawing from a friend.

    Thomas Jefferson


    27
    If you do your duty, it will be just as well with you, as though all men embraced the gospel. TPJS, 43.


    28
    Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the grand council in heaven before this world was. I suppose I was ordained to this very office in that grand council. TPJS, 365.


    29
    All are to preach the gospel, by the power and influence of the Holy Ghost; and no man can preach the gospel without the Holy Ghost...we find few qualified even to be priests, and if a priest understands his duty, his calling, and ministry, and preaches by the Holy Ghost, his enjoyment is as great as if he were one of the Presidency. TPJS, 112.


    30
    Our affections should be placed upon God and his work more intensely than upon our fellow beings. TPJS, 216.


    31
    Teaching is 90% modeling and relating and 10% talking. Our actions must be in harmony with our words to effectively teach.

    Boyd K. Packer


    32
    What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you say. Ralph Waldo Emerso


    33
    It is a simple fact that truth has ever entailed an unfriendly reception at the hands of men. Alvin R. Dyer, Who am I?, 100.


    34
    The most damage to the church is done by those who straddle the line, with one foot in the kingdom and the other in spiritual Babylon. These people are playing on the Lord’s and Satan’s team...waiting to see which is winning before choosing sides.

    J. Richard Clarke, “Hold Up Your Light,” Ensign, May 1985, 74.


    35
    We, the Latter-day Saints, take the liberty of believing more than our Christian brethren: we not only believe . . . the Bible, but . . . the whole of the plan of salvation that Jesus has given to us. Do we differ from others who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ? No, only in believing more. Brigham Young, J.D., 13:56.


    36
    Latter-day Saints cannot jettison what they believe to be the language of the Lord to Joseph Smith in 1820 in order to allay hurt feelings or court favor. We hold to the truth that God has spoken anew in our day and restored his everlasting gospel through living prophets. This is our distinctive position, our contribution to a world that desperately needs a belief in God, an understanding of his grand plan of salvation, the promise and hope that come from a Redeemer, and confirming evidence for the historical veracity of the Holy Bible. Robert L. Millet, The Vision of Mormonism, 194.


    37
    While one portion of the human race is judging and condemning the other without mercy, the Great Parent of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard; He views them as His offspring, and without any of those contracted feelings that influence the children of men, causes ‘His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.’ He holds the reins of judgment in His hands; He is a wise Lawgiver, and will judge all men, not according to the narrow, contracted notions of men, but according to the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil. . . . We need not doubt the wisdom and intelligence of the Great Jehovah. TPJS, 218.


    38
    God, the Father of us all, uses the men of the earth, especially good men, to accomplish his purposes. It has been true in the past, it is true today, it will be true in the future. Ezra Taft Benson, “Civic Standards for the Faithful Saints,” Ensign, July 1972, 59.


    39
    Perhaps the Lord needs such men on the outside of his Church, to help it along. They are among its auxiliaries, and can do more good for the cause where the Lord has placed them, than anywhere else. . . some are drawn into the fold and receive a testimony of the Truth; while others remain unconverted. . . the beauties and glories of the gospel being veiled temporarily from their view. . . Again I say, the Lord’s Work has need of auxiliaries outside as well as inside, to help it along. . . many are kept where they are, where the Lord has placed them, and can best use them for the good of all. . .



    God is using more than one people for the accomplishment of His great and marvelous work. The Latter-day Saints cannot do it all. It is too vast, too arduous for any one people. Orson F. Whitney, CR April 1928, 59. 


    40
    The interaction of God’s perfect light with the imperfect human filters who function as its receptors gives rise to many different intensities of light, some brighter and some darker. To recognize, to love, and to commit to the brightest of these lights does not require the denial of light in any of its other manifestations. Mauro Properzi, “Learning About Other Religions,” Religious Educator, Vol 16:1, 142.


    41
    The great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God’s light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals. First Presidency Statement, God’s Love for All Mankind, February 15, 1978.


    42
    Have the Presbyterians any truth? Yes. Have the Baptists, Methodists, etc., any truth? Yes. They all have a little truth mixed with error. We should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up, or we shall not come out true ‘Mormons.’ TPJS, 316.


    43
    Do we believe that all ministers of other churches are corrupt? Of course not. . . . It is clearly apparent that there have been and now are many choice, honorable, and devoted men and women going in the direction of their eternal salvation who give righteous and conscientious leadership to their congregations in other churches. William Bangerter, 1984-85 BYU Speeches of the Year, 161.


    44
    We don’t ask people to throw away any good they have got, we only ask them to come and get more.

    Joseph Smith, Teachings of Presidents of the Church, 264.


    45
    We have no animosity toward any other church. We do not oppose other churches. We never speak negatively of other churches. We say to people: you bring all the good that you have, and let us see if we can add to it. Gordon B. Hinkley, Larry King Interview, 1998.


    46
    The cause in which we are laboring is true. We respect the beliefs of our friends and neighbors. We are all sons and daughters of God. We can learn much from other men and women of faith and goodness. . . .



    Yet we know that Jesus is the Christ. He is resurrected. In our day, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the priesthood of God has been restored. We have the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Book of Mormon is what we claim it to be. The promises of the temple are certain. . . . It's true, isn't it? Then what else matters? Neal L. Andersen, "It's True, Isn't it? Then What Else Matters?" Ensign, May 2007, 72-73.


    47
    Persecution has not stopped the progress of truth, but has only added fuel to the flame, it has spread with increasing rapidity. Proud of the cause which they have espoused and conscious of our innocence and of the truth of their system, midst calumny and reproach, have the elders of this Church gone forth and planted the gospel in almost every state in the Union. It has penetrated our cities; it has spread over our villages and has caused thousands of our intelligent, noble, and patriotic citizens to obey its divine mandates and be governed by its sacred truths. It has also spread into England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, where, in the year 1840, a few of our missionaries were sent, and over five thousand joined the Standard of Truth; there are numbers now joining in every land.



    Our missionaries are going forth to different nations, and in Germany, Palestine, New Holland, Australia, the East Indies, and other places, the Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear; till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done. Joseph Smith, Wentworth Letter, March 1, 1942. 


    48
    Having found and baptized a new convert, we have the challenge of fellowshipping him and strengthening his testimony of the truth of this work. We cannot have him walking in the front door and out the back. Joining the Church is a very serious thing. Each convert takes upon himself or herself the name of Christ with an implied promise to keep His commandments. But coming into the Church can be a perilous experience. Unless there are warm and strong hands to greet the convert, unless there is an outreach of love and concern, he will begin to wonder about the step he has taken. Unless there are friendly hands and welcome hearts to greet him and lead him along the way, he may drop by the side. There is absolutely no point in doing missionary work unless we hold on to the fruits of that effort. The two must be inseparable. Every new convert is entitled to three things: a friend; an assignment or Church calling; and nourishing by the good word of God. Gordon B. Hinkley, "Feed the Lambs, Feed the Sheep," Ensign, May 1999, 108.
