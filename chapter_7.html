                    The phrase “natural man” is understood by Latter-day Saints to be an unrepentant person; it does not imply that mortals are by nature depraved or evil, but only that they are in a fallen condition. Natural man describes persons who are “without God in the world, and the have gone contrary to the nature of God.” </p>

                    There is a natural birth, and there is a spiritual birth. The natural birth is to die as pertaining to premortal life, to leave the heavenly realms where all spirits dwell in the Divine Presence, and to begin a new life, a mortal life, a life here on earth. The natural birth creates a natural man, and the natural man is an enemy to God. In his fallen state he is carnal, sensual, and devilish by nature. Appetites and passions govern his life and he is alive – acutely so–to all that is evil and wicked in the world. </p>

                    Death entered the world by means of Adam's fall---death of two kinds, temporal and spiritual. Temporal death passes upon all men when they depart this mortal life. . . . Spiritual death passes upon all men when they become accountable for their sins. Being thus subject to sin they die spiritually; they die as pertaining to the things of the spirit; they die as pertaining to the things of righteousness; they are cast out of the presence of God. It is of such men that the scriptures speak when they say that the natural man is an enemy to God. </p>

                    Every person who is in the world, who has ever been born into the world, who arrives at the years of accountability without being baptized, dies spiritually. Since the Fall of Adam, according to our revelations, all accountable men have become carnal, sensual, and devilish by nature. This is called the natural man.

                    Adam’s fall brought death into the world. Because of the nature of this fallen state, men are alienated from things of righteousness; they are without God in the world, and most of earth’s inhabitants choose to walk in broad and forbidden paths—they go contrary to the things of God and thus contrary to the nature of happiness. They become natural men, enemies to God and thus enemies to their own best interests . . . </p>

                    Adam fell. We know that this fall came because of transgression, and that Adam broke the law of God, became mortal, and was thus subject to sin and disease and all the ills of mortality. We know that the effects of his fall passed upon all his posterity; all inherited a fallen state, a state of mortality, a state in which temporal and spiritual death prevail. In this state all men sin. All are lost. All are fallen. All are cut off from the presence of God. All have become carnal, sensual, and devilish by nature. Such a way of life is inherent in this mortal existence. </p>

                    The natural man is an enemy to God in that he or she is operating on an agenda other than God’s. The natural man does everything in his or her power to bring to pass selfish whims and wishes and, in general, has placed his or her will above that of the Captain of our souls. President Brigham Young taught that “the natural man is at enmity with God. That fallen nature in every one is naturally opposed, inherently, through the fall, to God and to His Kingdom, and wants nothing to do with them.” Such persons are thereby operating at cross-purposes to the Father’s plan for the salvation and redemption of his children and thus prove to be their own worst enemy as well. </p>

                    How difficult it is to teach the natural man, who comprehends nothing more than that which he sees with the natural eye! . . . Talk to him about angels, heavens, God, immortality, and eternal lives, and it is like sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal to his ears; it has no music to him; there is nothing in it that charms his senses, soothes his feelings, attracts his attention, or engages his affections, in the least. </p>

                    Man has a dual nature; one, related to the earthly or animal life; the other, akin to the divine. Whether a man remains satisfied within what we designate the animal world, satisfied with what the animal world will give him, yielding without effort to the whim of his appetites and passions and slipping farther and farther into the realm of indulgence, or whether, through self-mastery, he rises toward intellectual, moral, and spiritual enjoyments depends upon the kind of choice he makes every day, nay, every hour of his life. </p>

                    To reconcile the conflict between what God wants and what the natural man wants, either the natural man has to repent or the doctrines of God have to change. The pure in heart are those whose beliefs are a higher priority than their behavior. They continually seek to modify their behavior, conforming it to their beliefs. Contrast this to the natural man whose first priority is his behavior. He will modify his beliefs to justify his behavior.

                    This explains the motive behind all apostasy from the true plan of salvation ever since the time of Adam. It is not really the doctrines that people don’t like, it is the commandments connected to them. </p>

                    It is true that all humankind are the literal spirit sons and daughters of a divine and exalted Father and that we have the capacity to become as he is. And yet, the Fall does indeed take a toll on all humankind. It is real. Its effects cannot be ignored, nor can its pull on the human heart be mitigated by enlightened conversation. A person’s capacity to become Christlike is one thing; his or her inclination to sin is quite another. It is only as men and women overcome the effects of the Fall through the atoning blood and ransoming power of Jesus Christ that they place themselves on the path to salvation. </p>

                    Natural men and women are fallen beings who remain in that condition, living without God and godliness in the world. They are unredeemed creatures who live by their own light. On the one hand, natural men and women may be bent on lechery and lasciviousness; they may love Satan more than God and are therefore “carnal, sensual, and devilish”. . .


                    <br><br>
                    On the other hand, natural men and women need not be what we would call degenerate. They may well be moral and upright men and women, bent on goodness and benevolence. Nevertheless, they operate in and are acclimated to the present fallen world. Such persons do not enjoy the enlivening powers of the Holy Ghost, have not received the revealed witness of the truth, and have not enjoyed the sanctifying powers of the blood of Christ. . .

                    <br><br>

                    Members of the Church who refuse to climb toward greater spiritual heights, who have no inclination to further anchor themselves in the truth, and who have become satisfied with their present spiritual state are natural men and women, persons generally of goodwill who do not understand that through their smugness and complacency they are aiding and abetting the cause of the enemy of all righteousness. </p>

                    Some have come to think of activity in the Church as the ultimate goal. Therein lies a danger. It is possible to be active in the Church and less active in the gospel. Let me stress: activity in the Church is a highly desirable goal; however, it is insufficient. Activity in the Church is an outward indication of our spiritual desire. If we attend our meetings, hold and fulfill Church responsibilities, and serve others, it is publicly observed.

                    <br><br>

                    By contrast, the things of the gospel are usually less visible and more difficult to measure, but they are of greater eternal importance. For example, how much faith do we really have? How repentant are we? How meaningful are the ordinances in our lives? How focused are we on our covenants?

                    <br><br>

                    I repeat: we need the gospel and the Church. In fact, the purpose of the Church is to help us live the gospel. We often wonder: How can someone be fully active in the Church as a youth and then not be when they are older? How can an adult who has regularly attended and served stop coming? How can a person who was disappointed by a leader or another member allow that to end their Church participation? Perhaps the reason is they were not sufficiently converted to the gospel–the things of eternity. </p>

                    There are many members of the Church who are lax and careless and who continually procrastinate. They live the gospel casually but not devoutly. They have complied with some requirements but are not valiant. They do no major crime but merely fail to do the things required–things like paying tithing, living the Word of Wisdom, having family prayers, fasting, attending meetings, serving.


                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps they do not consider such omissions to be sins, yet these were the kinds of things of which the five foolish virgins . . . were probably guilty. The ten virgins belonged to the kingdom and had every right to the blessings—except that five were not valiant and were not ready when the great day came. They were unprepared through not living all the commandments. They were bitterly disappointed at being shut out from the marriage—as likewise their modern counterparts will be. </p>

                    We should't be surprised when we suffer a failure of faith if we walk on the margins of the strait and narrow path. What we do and don't do really matters because actions have consequences, as does inaction. When we become inattentive to the small, daily, repetitive but essential actions of belief, we weaken our roots. Over time we slowly draw away from God.
                    <br><br>


                    Thus, the way we speak to each other, the books and articles we read, the television shows and movies we watch, the things we don't read and would never watch, and the jokes we choose not to listen to or repeat all reflect where we are on the strait and narrow path---in the center or on the edges. We can't claim to be nourishing our roots if the things we do and don't do aren't calculated to make us better Saints. Safety is found only in the center of the strait and narrow path. </p>

                    Good, upright, decent members of the Church who nonetheless do not put first in their lives the things of God’s earthly kingdom [are lukewarm. (Rev 3:16.)] They have testimonies; they know the work is true; but they specialize, as it were, in the social gospel; that is, in that portion of the truth which seems to bless others on pretty much the same basis as people are bettered by any good concepts in any church. Their interests are largely centered in temporal things, in making a living, in the things of this world. They are not wicked and ungodly in the sense of being carnal and evil. But they are not devoting their energies to the spread of truth and the perfecting of the lives of their brethren. They are probably part tithepayers, and they likely go to sacrament meeting and perform church service when it is convenient. They seek the honors of men and the wealth of the world with more zeal than they do the honors of God and the riches of eternity. They are lukewarm and their souls will not be saved. ‘These are they who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore, they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God.’

                    <br><br>

                    Lukewarm church members say: ‘We have testimonies, we have received the gospel, we belong to the Church; surely we shall be saved along with all the rest; what more do we need?” But the fact is (and they know it not!) they are no better off spiritually than many nonmembers of the Church; they are still poor in the things of the Spirit, are blind to the real blessings of the gospel, and have not in fact put on the robes of righteousness.</p>

                    As the scripture says, "Wickedness never was happiness," but neither is lukewarmness full happiness. Failing to be valiant in Christian discipleship will leave us without significant happiness. Therefore, our active avoidance of wickedness must be followed by our active engagement in righteousness. . . . It is very often the sins of omission that keep us from spiritual wholeness. </p>

                    As we look about us we perceive that unfortunately some Church members are . . . scattered all along the straight and narrow path. The enlightened are moving forward steadily toward becoming men and women of Christ. Others are moving, but only irregularly. Some are dawdling. Still others are milling round the exits and entrances. A few have turned back or been turned aside. Others are moving but, having pursued the wrong azimuth, find themselves caught in various cul-de-sacs. </p>

                    There is a story about a young man who is standing on a wall. On one side are the Savior and other faithful members beckoning the young man to come down off the wall and be with them. Their shouts of encouragement are constant and fervent.


                    <br><br>
                    On the other side of the wall are the devil and his minions. Much to the young man’s surprise, they are not as passionate as those on the other side. In fact, they seem quite content to let the young man stay where he is. In his confused curiosity, he asks Satan, “Why aren’t you and your followers enticing me to come and join you?” After a short pause, Satan coyly replies, “I own the wall.”

                    <br><br>

                    All of us find ourselves on “the wall” of decision at times. Staying on the wall too long situates us in Satan’s territory by default. . . . When it comes to important matters pertaining to the gospel, the Lord is not pleased when we loiter about on the wall of indecision. . . . Lingering indecision allows doubt to flourish and leads us into Satan’s territory.

                    Spiritual apathy is best described as a lack of diligence in spiritual matters. While sin commonly involves things we do that we shouldn’t, spiritual apathy largely constitutes things we don’t do that we should. However, it is crucial to realize that those who are spiritual apathetic experience the same consequence as the sinner—a loss of the Spirit. </p>

                    The spiritual birth comes after the natural birth. It is to die as pertaining to worldliness and carnality and to become a new creature by the power of the Spirit. It is to begin a new life, a life in which we bridle our passions and control our appetites, a life of righteousness, a spiritual life. Whereas we were in a deep abyss of darkness, now we are alive in Christ and bask in the shining rays of his everlasting light. Such is the new birth, the second birth, the birth into the household of Christ. </p>

                    If a man “yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord,” then he is born again. His spiritual death ceases. He becomes alive to the things of the Spirit; he returns to the presence of God because he receives the gift of the Holy Ghost; and he is alive to the things of righteousness.

                    This life is set up so that we temporarily lose sight of who we really are. In taking on the experience of this life we have agreed to forego our immediate memory of our true heritage and home. Giving up our memory of who we really are was a risk, for we may not remember. Our course of progression was stopped, damned in its onward progress, unless we took this path. Only by forgetting could we truly choose to enter into a genuine relationship with God.

                    <br><br>

                    Life is set up so that God’s presence and existence are only detectable by those who have eyes to see and ears to hear the subtle signs of His loving overtures. The critical moment is the choice to open our hearts to feel—for the heart is the door to the eternal spirit. God has left us an instrument that still vibrates in recognition and remembrance. Our hearts sing to us and burn in recognition when the truth is spoken.

                    <br><br>

                    The image of a soft or open heart recurs in the Book of Mormon more than a hundred times. In virtually every account in the Book of Mormon, the problem is a hard heart and the solution is a soft heart. These passages are not referring to the physical part of our bodies that pumps blood. Rather, the scriptures are referring to our very center, the core of who we are, where we find the connection to who and what we really are eternally.


                    <br><br>
                    God does not look on the outward appearance. Instead, when God looks at us, He sees our heart and our eternal core that shine with truth. In our hearts we are connected to eternity, for the energy of light and vibration of love still burns there if we are open to encounter it. The primary challenge of sin is a problem of heart. Sin interferes with our ability to connect to eternity, to feel God’s love and constant, still whisper. Moreover, the decision to harden our heart is ours alone. . .
                    <br><br>


                    The heart is experienced as an instrument of knowing. Thoughts, both evil and good, come out of the heart. The heart is the place where the real or authentic person proceeds from, for God looks upon the heart rather than outward appearances to know a person as he or she is. . .
                    <br><br>


                    The prophets know the ways of the heart and that is what distinguishes them from philosophers who know only the ways of the head. In contrast to the heart, which is the connection to our eternal intelligence, the head is merely the world’s best computer. The head is a piece of complex flesh that knows only a beginning and ending. By “head” I mean that complex system that includes our brain and central nervous system, which translates sense experience and give rise to the categories of logic, language, and thought. It knows only what can be learned through the senses of our bodies and categories of reason.

                    <br><br>

                    In contrast, the heart is the home of our eternal identity. It can be opened or shut, hard or soft. The heart can be made “hard” so that the light of spirit and truth cannot penetrate it. The heart must be “opened” to understand. The heart must be “penetrated,” “pricked,” “melted,” “softened” so that truth is known, pretense is given up and humility in God’s presence can be manifested. A soft heart is open and permeable to the spirit and receives the “word of God.”

                    A hard heart is like a wall or barrier that is erected around the very center of who we really are. A hard heart shuts us inside walls of our own making and shuts every one else (including God) out. A hard heart does not feel and cannot remember. The light of truth cannot penetrate a hard heart. The doors of the heart can be opened or closed only from the inside. God will not and cannot force open a closed heart. The choice to open my heart is intrinsically, by its very nature, only an act I can do. I hold the key to my heart.


                    <br><br>
                    What we are in our hearts is who we truly are. At our core we already know the truth, for God’s word and law are implanted there. The word of God is never far off. Because it is written in our hearts, only a person who has chosen to build walls around the heart could miss the voice of God constantly whispering in the heart, for, God is always as near as one’s own heart.

                    The gospel of Jesus Christ encompasses much more than avoiding, overcoming, and being cleansed from sin and the bad influences in our lives; it also essentially entails doing good, being good, and becoming better. Repenting of our sins and seeking forgiveness are spiritually necessary, and we must always do so. But remission of sin is not the only or even the ultimate purpose of the gospel. To have our hearts changed by the Holy Spirit . . . is the covenant responsibility we have accepted. This mighty change is not simply the result of working harder or developing greater individual discipline. Rather, it is the consequence of a fundamental change in our desires, our motives, and our natures made possible through the Atonement of Christ the Lord. Our spiritual purpose is to overcome both sin and the desire to sin, both the taint and the tyranny of sin. </p>

                    We must be careful, as we seek to become more and more godlike, that we do not become discouraged and lose hope.Becoming Christlike is a lifetime pursuit and very often involves growth and change that is slow, almost imperceptible. Regarding the sudden spiritual transformations of such notables as Alma the Younger, Paul, Enos and King Lamoni, “We must be cautious as we discuss these remarkable examples. Though they are real and powerful, they are the exception more than the rule. For every Paul, for every Enos, and for every King Lamoni, there are hundreds and thousands of people who find the process of repentance much more subtle, much more imperceptible. Day by day they move closer to the Lord, little realizing they are building a godlike life. </p>

                    We are born again when we die as pertaining to unrighteousness and when we live as pertaining to the things of the Spirit. But that doesn’t happen in an instant, suddenly. That also is a process. Being born again is a gradual thing, except in a few isolated instances that are so miraculous they get written up in the scriptures. As far as the generality of the members of the Church are concerned, we are born again by degrees, and we are born again to added light and added knowledge and added desires for righteousness as we keep the commandments.


                    <br><br>
                    The same thing is true of being sanctified. Those who go to the celestial kingdom of heaven have to be sanctified, meaning that they become clean and pure and spotless. They’ve had evil and sin and iniquity burned out of their souls as though by fire, and the figurative expression there is “the baptism of fire”. Here again it is a process. Nobody is sanctified in an instant, suddenly. But if we keep the commandments and press forward with steadfastness after baptism, then degree by degree and step by step we sanctify our souls until that glorious day when we’re qualified to go where God and angels are. . .As it is with being born again, and as it is with sanctifying our souls, so becoming perfect in Christ is a process.

                    As members of the Church, if we chart a course leading to eternal life; if we begin the processes of spiritual rebirth, and are going in the right direction; if we chart a course of sanctifying our souls, and degree by degree are going in that direction; and if we chart a course of becoming perfect, and, step by step and phase by phase, are perfecting our souls by overcoming the world, then it is absolutely guaranteed–there is no question whatever about it–we shall gain eternal life. Even though we have spiritual rebirth ahead of us, perfection ahead of us, the full degree of sanctification ahead of us, if we chart a course and follow it to the best of our ability in this life, then when we go out of this life we’ll continue in exactly that same course. We’ll no longer be subject to the passions and the appetites of the flesh. We will have passed successfully the tests of this mortal probation and in due course we’ll get the fulness of our Father’s kingdom–and that means eternal life in his everlasting presence.

                    <br><br>

                    The Prophet told us that there are many things that people have to do, even after the grave, to work out their salvation. We’re not going to be perfect the minute we die. But if we’ve charted a course, if our desires are right, if our appetites are curtailed and bridled, and if we believe in the Lord and are doing to the very best of our abilities what we ought to do, we’ll go on to everlasting salvation, which is the fulness of eternal reward in our Father’s kingdom. </p>

                    We don’t need to get a complex or get a feeling that you have to be perfect to be saved. You don’t. There’s only been one perfect person, and that’s the Lord Jesus, but in order to be saved in the Kingdom of God and in order to pass the test of mortality, what you have to do is get on the straight and narrow path—thus charting a course leading to eternal life—and then, being on that path, pass out of this life in full fellowship. I’m not saying you don’t have to keep the commandments. I’m saying you don’t have to be perfect to be saved. If you did, no one would be saved. The way it operates is this: you get on the path that’s named the “straight and narrow.” You do it by entering the gate of repentance and baptism, a very great distance, to a reward that’s called eternal life. If you’re on that path and pressing forward, and you die, you’ll never get off the path. There is no such thing as falling off the straight and narrow path in the life to come, and the reason is that this life is the time that is given to men to prepare for eternity. Now is the time and the day of your salvation, so if you’re working zealously in this life—though you haven’t fully overcome the world and you haven’t done all you hoped you might do—you’re still going to be saved. You don’t have to do what Jacob said, ‘Go beyond the mark.’ You don’t have to live a life that’s truer than true. You don’t have to have an excessive zeal that becomes fanatical and becomes unbalancing. What you have to do is stay in the mainstream of the Church and live as upright and decent people live in the Church—keeping the commandments, paying your tithing, serving in the organizations of the Church, loving the Lord, staying on the straight and narrow path. If you’re on that path when death comes—because this is the time and the day appointed, this is the probationary state—you’ll never fall off from it, and, for all practical purposes, your calling and election is made sure. </p>

                    A man’s mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or neglected, it must, and will, bring forth. If no useful seeds are put into it, then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will fall therein, and will continue to produce their kind.

                    <br><br>

                    Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts. By pursuing this process, a man sooner or later discovers that he is the master gardener of his soul, the director of his life. He also reveals, within himself, the laws of thought, and understands with ever-increasing accuracy, how the thought-forces and mind-elements operate in the shaping of his character, circumstances, and destiny.

                    Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself, the shaper and author of environment. . . .

                    <br><br>
                    Let a man radically alter his thoughts, and he will be astonished at the rapid transformation it will effect in the material conditions of his life. Men imagine that thought can be kept secret, but it cannot; it rapidly crystallizes into habit, and habit solidifies into circumstance. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    A particular train of thought persisted in, be it good or bad, cannot fail to produce its results on the character and circumstances. A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances. </p>

Perhaps as we consider the experiences of Joseph in the Sacred Grove, of Saul on the road to Damascus, and of Alma the Younger, we come to believe something is wrong with or lacking in us if we fall short in our lives of these well-known and spiritually striking examples.

                    Christ’s Atonement overcomes the effects of the Fall, but it doesn’t help us overcome bad habits unless we receive and apply it over time. . . . Those who dwell with Christ are those who have come to be like Him through fulfilling what He asks. The justified must still be sanctified. The “new” must become “new and improved.” Those who are declared “not guilty” must become worthy, even holy, and this doesn’t happen automatically or quickly. </p>

                    We need to come to terms with our desire to reach perfection and our frustration when our accomplishments or behaviors are less than perfect. I believe that one of the great myths we would do well to dispel is that we have come to earth to perfect ourselves, and that nothing short of that will do. If I understand the teachings of the prophets of this dispensation correctly, we will not become perfect in this life, though we can make significant strides toward that goal.

                    <br><br>

                    I am also convinced that the speed with which we head along the straight and narrow path isn’t as important as the direction in which we are traveling. That direction, if it is leading toward eternal goals, is the all-important factor. </p>

                    Desires dictate our priorities, priorities shape our choices, and choices determine our actions. The desires we act on determine our changing, our achieving, and our becoming. . . . Righteous desires cannot be superficial, impulsive, or temporary. They must be heartfelt, unwavering, and permanent. So motivated, we will seek for that condition described by the Prophet Joseph Smith, where we have “overcome the evils of our lives and lost every desire for sin.” That is a very personal decision. . . . Therefore, what we insistently desire, over time, is what we will eventually become and what we will receive in eternity. </p>

                    Just because something is good is not a sufficient reason for doing it. The number of good things we can do far exceeds the time available to accomplish them. Some things are better than good, and these are the things that should command priority attention in our lives. . .<br><br>



                    As we consider various choices, we should remember that it is not enough that something is good. Other choices are better, and still others are best. Even though a particular choice is more costly, its far greater value may make it the best choice of all. Consider how we use our time in the choices we make in viewing television, playing video games, surfing the Internet, or reading books or magazines. Of course it is good to view wholesome entertainment or to obtain interesting information. But not everything of that sort is worth the portion of our life we give to obtain it. Some things are better, and others are best. . .<br><br>

                    <br><br>

                    Some uses of individual and family time are better, and others are best. We have to forego some good things in order to choose others that are better or best because they develop faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthen our families. </p>

                    In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us to know something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to become something. . . . The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts–what we have done. It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts–what we have become. It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    The gospel of Jesus Christ is the plan by which we can become what children of God are supposed to become. This spotless and perfected state will result from a steady succession of covenants, ordinances, and actions, an accumulation of right choices, and from continuing repentance. . . . We qualify for eternal life through a process of conversion. As used here this word of many meanings signifies not just a convincing but a profound change of nature. . .

                    <br><br>

                    We do not obtain our heavenly reward by punching a time clock. What is essential is that our labors in the workplace of the Lord have caused us to become something. For some of us, this requires a longer time than for others. What is important in the end is what we have become by our labors. </p>

                    Walking the spiritual path properly is a very subtle process. . . . There are numerous sidetracks which lead to a distorted, ego-centered version of spirituality; we can deceive ourselves into thinking we are developing spiritually when instead we are strengthening our egocentricity through spiritual techniques. This fundamental distortion may be referred to as spiritual materialism. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    Ego is able to convert everything to its own use, even spirituality. . . . When we have learned all the tricks and answers of the spiritual game, we automatically try to imitate spirituality, since real involvement would require the complete elimination of ego, and actually the last thing we want to do is give up the ego completely. However, we cannot experience that which we are trying to imitate; we can only find some area within the bounds of ego that seems to be the same thing. . . .



                    If we become successful at maintaining our self-consciousness through spiritual techniques, then genuine spiritual development is highly unlikely. </p>

We are not satisfied by a superficial modification of behavior patterns in conformity to some Christian sub-culture which expects this, commands that and prohibits the other. No, what we long for is a deep inward change of character, resulting from a change of nature and leading to a radical change of conduct. In a word we want to be like Christ, and that thoroughly, profoundly, entirely. Nothing less than this will do. </p>

                    We should all be striving for a disposition to do no evil, but to do good continually. This isn’t a resolve or a discipline; it is a disposition. We do things because we want to, not just because we know we should. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Sometimes we overlook the fact that a spiritual transformation or metamorphosis must take place within us. It comes about through grace and by the Spirit of God, although it does not come about until we have truly repented and proven ourselves worthy. We can be guilty of being so careful to live the letter of the law that we don’t develop our inner spiritual nature and fine-tune our spiritual communication to the point that we may receive sanctification and purification. My conclusion is that we will not be saved by works if those works are not born of a disposition to do good, as opposed to an obligation to do good. </p>

I know that the power of change is in Jesus Christ, and that dramatic and rapid change can take place. Though I do not know whether the Lord will change us right away, I do know this: If we do what we have been asked to do, and if we do it regularly and consistently from now on, God will change us, either here or hereafter. We may be required to deal with many temptations until the day we die. But I can promise you two things. First, these feelings will eventually be transformed. Second, if God does not choose to bring about a major change in our nature in this life, he will strengthen and empower us to deal with the temptations we will face.

                    The statement—“a saint is a sinner who keeps on trying”—should reassure and encourage members of the Church. Although we are referred to as “Latter-day Saints,” we sometimes flinch at this reference. The term Saints is commonly useto designate those who have achieved an elevated state of holiness or even perfection. And we know perfectly well that we are not perfect.

                    <br><br>

                    Our theology does teach us, though, that we may be perfected by repeatedly and continually “relying wholly upon” the doctrine of Christ: exercising faith in Him, repenting, partaking of the sacrament to renew the covenants and blessings of baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost as a constant companion to a greater degree. As we do so, we become more like Christ and are able to endure to the end, with all that that entails. In less formal terms, God cares a lot more about who we are and who we are becoming than about who we once were. He cares that we keep on trying. </p>

Some people will have good times and some will not, but the only losers are those who give up and quit before they reach the goal. In the gospel race there are no losers, only quitters. Those who run across the finish line in minutes, those who walk across it in hours, or those who crawl across it in days all win the prize. For they all endured to the end, according to their talents and abilities, looking to the Savior. </p>

                    Perfection is more about intent than it is about polish. The perfecting process is designed to liberate us from an anxious self-absorption. Our joys should deepen. But if our stress gets heavier and our death-wish stronger, we should remind ourselves that our mandate is centered in our loving relationship with our Heavenly Father and the welfare of His children.

                    Intent is the purifying issue. With purified intent and steadfastness in Christ, it may be that we can reach that point at which we live largely without sin—not without mistakes, errors in judgement, etc.—but without the impure motives which create sin. </p>

                    Being born again comes not simply as a result of a new way of thinking; it is far more than a shift in one’s mental pattern. It comes by the blood of Christ through the transforming medium of the Holy Ghost. It is a change which is beyond the reach of man—even charismatic and capable man—to perform; it is a change that is of God, not man. </p>

                    The sanctifying grace of the Savior Jesus Christ is the source of an entire cluster of blessings and powers. The Atonement not only atones for our sins and compensates for our inadequacies, it is also the source of spiritual endowments that develop and ultimately transform our very nature.<br><br>



                    The agent by which many of these forces enter our lives is the Holy Ghost. . . Some manifestations of this sanctifying process may reflect the Holy Ghost’s mission to act as a comforter, to bear witness of the Father and the Son, and to “teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance.” The gift of the Holy Ghost thus goes well beyond a right to divine inspiration and guidance. </p>

                    The Holy Ghost is the midwife of salvation. He is the agent of the new birth, the sacred channel and power by which men and women are changed and renewed, made into new creatures. This new birth, which comes in process of time, brings membership in the family of God: such persons are redeemed from the Fall, reconciled to the Father through the Son, and made worthy of designation of sons and daughters of Jesus Christ. They come to see and feel and understand things which the spiritually lifeless can never know. They become participants in the realm of divine experience. </p>

                    If we die in the faith, that is the same thing as saying that our calling and election has been made sure and that we will go on to eternal reward hereafter. As far as faithful members of the Church are concerned, they have charted a course leading to eternal life. This life is the time that is appointed as a probationary estate for men to prepare to meet God, and as far as faithful people are concerned, if they are in the line of their duty, if they are doing what they ought to do, although they may not have been perfect in this sphere, their probation is ended. Now there will be some probation for some other people hereafter. But for the faithful Saints of God, now is the time and the day, and their probation is ended with their death, and they will not thereafter depart from the path. It is true, as the Prophet Joseph Smith said, that there are many things that have to be done “even beyond the grave” to work out our salvation, but we’ll stay in the course and we will not alter from it if we have been true and faithful in this life. </p>

                    I do not believe that any man lives up to his ideals, but if we are striving, if we are working, if we are trying, to the best of our ability, to improve day to day, then we are in the line of our duty. If we are seeking to remedy our own defects, if we are so living that we can ask God for light, for knowledge, for intelligence, and above all, for His Spirit, that we may overcome our weaknesses, then, I can tell you, we are in the straight and narrow path that leads to life eternal. Then we need have no fear. . . no man is perfect, but one who strives earnestly to conquer weaknesses and grow into perfection does not sin. That is to say, he is not a sinner. A sinner is one who indulges in sin habitually because he take pleasure in it. </p>

                    The gospel is in fact a gospel covenant—a two-way promise. The Lord agrees to do for us what we could never do for ourselves —to forgive our sins, to lift our burdens, to renew our souls and re-create our nature, to raise us from the dead and qualify us for glory hereafter. At the same time, we promise to do what we can do: receive the ordinances of salvation, love and serve one another and do all in our power to put off the natural man and deny ourselves of ungodliness. We believe that more is required of men and women than a verbal expression of faith in the Lord, more than a confession with the lips that we have received Christ into our hearts... We know, without question, that the power to save us, to change us, to renew our souls, is in Christ. True faith, however, always manifests itself in faithfulness. Good works evidence our faith, our desire to remain in covenant with Christ. But these good works, though necessary, are not sufficient. </p>

                    Daniel Tyler heard the Prophet Joseph explain that the birth spoken of in John 3:3 –the birth to see–“was not the gift of the Holy Ghost, which was promised after baptism, but was a portion of the spirit, which attended the preaching of the gospel by the elders of the Church. The people wondered why they had not previously understood the plain declarations of scripture, as explained by the elders, as they had read them hundreds of times. When they read the Bible [now] it was a new book to them. This was being born again, to see the Kingdom of God. They were not in it, but could see it from the outside, which they could not do until the Spirit of the Lord took the vail from before their eyes. It was a change of heart, but not of state; they were converted, but were yet in their sins. Although Cornelius [Acts 10] had seen an holy angel, and on the preaching of Peter the Holy Ghost was poured out upon him and his household, they were only born again to see the Kingdom of God. Had they not been baptized afterwards they would not have been saved. </p>

                    The symbol of cherubim and a flaming sword is a representation of an abstract spiritual principle called the law of justice. In simple terms we would say this: when any of us sins or transgresses (remember we are symbolically Adam and Eve), the law of justice says we cannot have eternal life! Because of sin, justice prevents us, impedes us, and blocks us from returning to our Heavenly Father's presence. . . . The good news is this though: we can get back, and we can have eternal life. This is possible because something or someone was provided by Father from the beginning to satisfy the demands of justice. A plan was given by the Father whereby we could be saved. This merciful plan satisfies the demands of justice. </p>

                    To be justified is to be pronounced clean, to be decreed innocent, to be delivered and protected from the demands of God’s justice, to be free from sin. This comes as one exercises faith in Christ and enters into a covenant relationship with him who is the Mediator of the new covenant. But the actual cleansing, the literal purification, does not take place through water baptism alone. Rather, one must receive the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost in order to begin the process of sanctification.

                    Justification is to be pronounced or declared clean or innocent. It means to be pardoned from punishment for sin and declared guiltless. A person is justified by the Savior’s grace through faith in him. Jesus Christ’s atonement enables mankind to repent and be justified or pardoned from punishment they otherwise would receive. Justification comes through the grace and mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ; therefore, it is something we cannot do to ourselves. Justification, which can occur immediately and repeatedly at various times in our lives, is akin to being forgiven of sin.
                    <br><br>


                    Sanctification also comes through the grace and mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ. Unlike justification, which is an event, sanctification is a process of becoming free from sin, pure, clean, and holy through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Whereas justification is to be pardoned or forgiven of sin, sanctification is to become free from the desire to sin. </p>

                    Justification does come through the Atonement of Christ and is confirmed to us by the Holy Ghost---not just with one single act in our lives but with many. We will have an endless amount of justification events that occur throughout our mortal sojourn as we repent, receive ordinances, take the sacrament, make covenants, and renew those covenants. Ultimately, even our calling and election and future perfection will be confirmed to us through the Holy Spirit's approval, which is synonymously called "the Holy Spirit of Promise." </p>

                    In a scriptural sense, justification is "to be forgiven of sin." But when we are sanctified, there is more. We are not just pardoned or forgiven of sin; we are actually overcoming the tendency or desire to sin in the first place. . . . It is one thing to go to the Lord (in faith and sincerity) and ask for a remission of our sins (justification). It is quite another to continually use His Atonement to overcome the desire to sin (sanctification). </p>

                    To be sanctified is to be cleansed, purified and made holy. . . . When a person is forgiven of sin, pardoned of misdeeds, pronounced innocent, and decreed righteous, that person has been justified; justification represents a change in the person’s standing before God. The process by which the children of God are purified and made free from the effects of sin, by which their state is changed, is sanctification. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    Sanctification is a lifetime process, one in which we gradually notice changes in our nature and disposition: we come to love the things we before hated (we begin to warm to and be attracted by goodness) and hate the things we before loved (we begin to find distasteful and to adhor such things as sin, uncleanness in its many forms, and the harsh, the crude, and the violent). </p>

Unlike justification, which is an event, sanctification is a process of becoming free from sin, pure, clean, and holy through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Whereas justification is to be pardoned or forgiven of sin, sanctification is to become free from the desire to sin. </p>

                    In a scriptural sense, justification is "to be forgiven of sin." But when we are sanctified, there is more. We are not just pardoned or forgiven of sin; we are actually overcoming the tendency or desire to sin in the first place. . . . It is one thing to go to the Lord (in faith and sincerity) and ask for a remission of our sins (justification). It is quite another to continually use His Atonement to overcome the desire to sin (sanctification). </p>

                    The Holy Ghost is the sanctifier, and it is his assignment to cleanse and purify the human soul, to burn the filth and dross from our hearts by fire. It is the Holy Spirit of God that erases carnality and brings us into a state of righteousness. Sanctification is a change of nature, a change of desire, a change not only of one’s discipline but of one’s disposition. It is one thing to simply stop doing wrong–which, of course, is terribly important–and another thing entirely to undergo the kind of spiritual metamorphosis in which the sinner is truly changed, his desires and longings and ambitions transformed, his inclinations and disposition altered. That process is sanctification. </p>

                    The cleansing process that occurs in our lives comes because we receive the cleansing power of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is a revelator, and the Holy Ghost is a sanctifier. The Holy Ghost reveals truth to every human soul that obeys the law. Obedience qualifies us to know the truth. And then the Holy Ghost sanctifies the human soul, so that we become clean and spotless and eventually are qualified to go where God and Christ are. </p>

                    We cannot, simply cannot face the challenges of life and triumph over the flesh without divine assistance. And so we worship and we pray, we labor and we trust in the merits and mercy of the Holy Messiah. And we rejoice in the reality that the Holy Ghost is given to prepare us for association with God and holy beings hereafter. Man’s natural powers are unequal to this task. Mankind stand in some need of a strength superior to any they possess of themselves, to accomplish this work of rendering pure our fallen nature. Such strength, such power, such sanctifying grace is conferred on man in being born of the Spirit – in receiving the Holy Ghost. Such, in the main, is its office, its work. </p>

                    Without the aid of the Holy Ghost, a person. . .would have but very little power to change his mind, at once, from its habituated course, and to walk in newness of life. Though his sins may have been cleansed away, yet so great is the force of habit, that he would, without being renewed by the Holy Ghost, be easily overcome, and contaminated by sin. Hence, it is infinitely important that the affections and desires should be, in a measure, changed and renewed, so as to cause him to hate that which he before loved and to love that which he before hated: to thus renew the mind of man is the work of the Holy Ghost. </p>

                    To be sanctified is to become clean, pure, and spotless; to be free from the blood and sins of the world; to become a new creature of the Holy Ghost, one whose body has been renewed by the rebirth of the Spirit. Sanctification is a state of saintliness, a state attained only by conformity to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. The plan of salvation is the system and means provided whereby men may sanctify their souls and thereby become worthy of a celestial inheritance. Sanctification is a basic doctrine of the gospel (D&amp;C 20:31-34); indeed, the very reason men are commanded to believe, repent, and be baptized is so they “may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost,” and thereby be enabled to stand spotless before the judgment bar of Christ. </p>

                    Those who go to the celestial kingdom of heaven have to be sanctified, meaning that they become clean and pure and spotless. They have had evil and iniquity burned out of their souls as though by fire, giving rise to the figurative expression “the baptism of fire.” Here again it is a process. Nobody is sanctified in an instant, suddenly. But if we keep the commandments and press forward with steadfastness after baptism, then degree by degree and step by step we sanctify our souls until that glorious day when we’re qualified to go where God and angels are. </p>

                    Christ justifies us by exchanging His goodness for our sin. He sanctifies us by exchanging our worldly natures for a celestial nature. Justification alters our standing. Sanctification alters our state. Justification frees us from sin’s penalty. Sanctification frees us from sin’s tyranny. While justification is represented by clean hands, sanctification is represented by a pure heart that has been given to God. </p>

                    God’s demand for perfection need not discourage you in the least in your present attempts to be good, or even in your present failures. Each time you fall He will pick you up again. And He knows perfectly well that your own efforts are never going to bring you anywhere near perfection. On the other hand, you must realize from the outset that the goal towards which He is beginning to guide you is absolute perfection; and no power in the whole universe, except you yourself, can prevent Him from taking you to that goal. That is what you are in for. And it is very important to realize that. If we do not, then we are very likely to start pulling back and resisting Him after a certain point. I think that many of us, when Christ has enabled us to overcome one of two sins that were an obvious nuisance, are inclined to feel (though we do not put it into words) that we are now good enough. He has done all we wanted Him to do, and we should be obliged if He would now leave us alone. As we say ‘I never expected to be a saint, I only wanted to be a decent ordinary chap.’ And we imagine when we say this that we are being humble.

                    <br><br>

                    But this is the fatal mistake. Of course we never wanted, and never asked, to be made into the sort of creatures He is going to make us into. But the question is not what we intended ourselves to be, but what He intended us to be when He made us. He is the inventor, we are only the machine. He is the painter, we are only the picture. How should we know what He means us to be like? . . .
                    <br><br>


                    Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on; you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make any sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of - throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were being made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself . . .<br><br>



                    That is why we must not be surprised if we are in for a rough time. When a man turns to Christ and seems to be getting on pretty well (in the sense that some of his bad habits are now corrected) he often feels that it would now be natural if things went fairly smoothly. When troubles come along–illnesses, money troubles, new kinds of temptations–he is disappointed. These things, he feels, might have been necessary to rouse him and make him repent in his bad old days; but why now? Because God is forcing him on, or up, to a higher level: putting him into situations where he will have to be very much braver, or more patient, or more loving, than he ever dreamed of being before. It seems to us all unnecessary: but that is because we have not yet had the slightest notion of the tremendous thing He means to make of us. . . . </p>

                    It is critical to note that the change of heart received by Benjamin’s followers was done for them, not by them. No matter how much they might have wanted a change to occur, they did not possess, of themselves, the power to make that change. Change of heart, like faith, hope, and charity, is a gift, bestowed on those who have placed themselves in a position to receive it.

                    We can distinguish more clearly between divine discontent and the devil’s dissonance, between dissatisfaction with self and disdain for self. We need the first and must shun the second, for when conscience calls to us from the next ridge, it is not solely to scold but also to beckon.
                    <br><br>


                    We can contemplate how far we have already come in the climb along the pathway to perfection; it is usually much further than we acknowledge, and such reflections restore resolve. . . .<br><br>



                    We can put our hand to the plow, looking neither back nor around, comparatively. Our opportunities as well as our gifts differ; some are more visible and impactful. . . .<br><br>



                    We can make quiet but more honest inventories of our strengths. Most of us are dishonest bookkeepers and need confirming “outside auditors.” He who in the first estate was thrust down delights in having us put ourselves down. Self- contempt is of Satan; there is none of it in heaven. We should, of course, learn from our mistakes, but without forever viewing the instant replays lest these become the game of life itself. . . .<br><br>



                    We can . . . keep moving. Crosses are easier to carry when we keep moving. Men finally climbed Mount Everest, not by standing at its base in consuming awe, but by shouldering their packs and by placing one foot in front of the other. Feet are made to move forward. </p>
