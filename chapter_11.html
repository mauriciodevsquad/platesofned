                    Some members, when confronted with incontrovertible evidence that the Church, its history, and its leaders are not perfect, arrive at an unexpected crisis of faith, and some of them conclude that because the Church is obviously not as perfect as they have perhaps been led to believe, it cannot be true either. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Any organization—the Church included—is a living, changing entity, an organism, as it were, composed not just of a hierarchical structure, but also of imperfect people, of an evolving culture, and of certain foundational ideas. In the Church, these foundational ideas include doctrines and principles that are constantly being examined, interpreted, and applied by Church leaders and members to ever-changing circumstances. So, if the lifeless institutional structure is the skeleton of the Church, then the living flesh of the organization is its members, with all their warts and blemishes. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    It becomes quickly apparent after even a cursory reading of Church history that the Lord wasn’t spelling out specifically how the Restoration should unfold. His hand was in the broad strokes, but the finer detail was and is tainted by human inadequacy and error. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    Maybe we just need to embrace a new metaphor. Perhaps it would be more useful to portray the Church not as a perfectly designed and smoothly functioning machine that sweeps up multitudes of converts and churns out prodigious quantities of laudable good works, but as a laboratory—God’s grand laboratory—where we are allowed to experiment with dangerous substances such as free will, authority, differing perspectives, disagreement, incomplete intelligence, and unrefined personalities. In this new metaphor, the Church is a somewhat-controlled environment where we don our lab coats, roll up our sleeves, and get down to the business of finding solutions to real problems. In our experiments, we are able to apply our minds, hearts, ingenuity, initiative, and faith in creating crude approximations of something truly wonderful. And if we sometimes mix the chemicals wrong and blow up part of the lab, so what? In this metaphor, there is also room, refreshingly, for such realities as humor and irony. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    Just as God does not condemn us individually as long as we are repenting and moving generally in the right direction—even if it seems at times tht we are stumbling and bumbling and meandering toward our eventual goal—so he also does not seem to mind if the Church takes a few missteps, adopts ineffective programs and wrongheaded policies, or even tramples a few toes, as long as it is moving overall in the right direction and accomplishing its purpose. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Trial and error is a cluttered and chaotic way to learn things, but sometimes it is the only way. . . . The reason for this is that in God’s mind perfection is the end result, not the process. It is the destination, not the path leading there. . . . What this means is that we have to learn to live with imperfections and inconsistencies, and this leaves the door wide open for a handful of paradoxes and ironies. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    Still, it is good to note that even with all its imperfections, the Church is nevertheless able to accomplish a great deal of good in the world and fulfill the basic function the Lord requires of it, which includes providing the ordinances of salvation, teaching fundamental gospel truths, offering a sanctuary from the wickedness of the world, and creating local communities within which we can support and love each other along the pathway to individual and collective perfection. </p>

                    The Church is true because it is concrete, not theoretical; in all its contradictions and problems, it is at least as productive of good as is the gospel.

                    <br><br>

                    Let us consider why this is so. In the life of the true Church, there are constant opportunities for all to serve, especially to learn to serve people we would not normally choose to serve—or possibly even associate with—and thus opportunities to learn to love unconditionally. There is constant encouragement, even pressure, to be “active”: to have a “calling” and thus to have to grapple with relationships and management, with other people’s ideas and wishes, their feelings and failures; to attend classes and meetings and to have to listen to other people’s sometimes misinformed or prejudiced notions and to have to make some constructive response; to have leaders and occasionally to be hurt by their weakness and blindness, even unrighteous dominion; and then to be made a leader and find that you, too, with all the best intentions, can be weak and blind and unrighteous. Church involvement teaches us compassion and patience as well as courage and discipline. It makes us responsible for the personal and marital, physical, and spiritual welfare of people we may not already love (or may even heartily dislike), and thus we learn to love them. It stretches and challenges us, though disappointed and exasperated, in ways we would not otherwise choose to be– and thus gives us a chance to be made better than we might choose to be, but ultimately need and want to be. . .

<br><br>

                    The church is as true as—perhaps truer than—the gospel because it is where all can find fruitful opposition, where its revealed nature and inspired direction maintain an opposition between liberal and conservative values, between faith and doubt, secure authority and frightening freedom, individual integrity and public responsibility, and thus where there will be misery as well as holiness, bad as well as good. And if we cannot stand the misery and the struggle, if we would prefer that the Church be smooth and perfect and unchallenging rather than as it is—full of nagging human diversity and constant insistence that we perform ordinances and obey instructions and take seriously teachings that embody logically irresolvable paradoxes—if we refuse to lose ourselves wholeheartedly in such a school, then we will never know the redeeming truth of the Church. It is precisely in the struggle to be obedient while maintaining integrity, to have faith while being true to reason and evidence, to serve and love in the face of imperfections and even offenses, that we can gain the humility we need to allow divine power to enter our lives in transforming ways. Perhaps the most amazing paradox about the Church is that it literally brings together the divine and the human through priesthood service, the ordinances, the gifts of the spirit—in concrete ways that no abstract system of ideas, even the gospel, ever could. . .

                    <br><br>

                    We must also, I believe, have more respect for the truth of action, of experience, which the Church uniquely exposes us to, and respond with courage and creativity—be active, critical, faithful, believing, doubting, struggling, unified members of the body of Christ. To do so, we must accept the Church as true in two important senses. First, it is a repository of redemptive truths and of the authority to perform saving ordinances. Though those truths are difficult to pin down to simple propositions, taken together, they create the willingness to serve that makes possible the redemptive schooling I have described. . .

                    <br><br>

                    Besides being the repository of true principles and authority, the Church is the instrument provided by a loving God to help us become like him. It gives us schooling and experiences with each other that can bind us in an honest but loving community, which is the essential nurturing place for salvation. If we cannot accept the Church and the challenges it offers with the openness and courage and humility they require, then I believe our historical studies and our theological enterprises are mainly a waste of time and possibly destructive. We cannot understand the meaning of the history of Mormonism or judge the truth of Christ’s restored gospel unless we appreciate—and act on—the truth of the Church. </p>

                    Trials of faith seldom arise from core Mormon beliefs; few struggle with commitment because their God is too benevolent, His plan too generous, the heaven we anticipate too rich in relationships and love. Doctrines, however, no matter how pure, do not exist in a vacuum. We encounter them through teachings, programs, manuals, personal interactions, and institutional forms and practices. And in the process, we occasionally find the pure gospel entangled with unfortunate ideas, pharisaical behavior, legalistic thinking, judgmentalism, and rules based more on tradition than inspiration. Those, of course, are the fruits of culture—a primarily western American Mormon culture almost two centuries in the making. They are not the gospel itself. </p>

                    Some individuals may wrestle with their faith or testimony, for example, because of concerns about episodes in Church history or because of unpleasant interactions with priesthood and auxiliary leaders. I believe the answer is to consider those historical events and interpersonal experiences in the totality of all things gathered together in one—and not allow an incident . . . or an uncertainty to obscure the view of the comprehensive majesty of this work. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    To dwell upon certain historical episodes . . . and become blinded to all of the truths gathered together in . . . Christ, in these latter days is unwise. Likewise, to focus upon human frailties so evident in all of us also is injudicious. I am not suggesting that we summarily dismiss or ignore challenging aspects of Church history or condone inappropriate behavior. Rather, I am recommending we look at the larger gospel perspective for greater context and deeper understanding. . . .
                    <br><br>


                    My hope, especially for people who are troubled by such occurrences, is that they will ask themselves this question: “Am I willing to set aside or lose the entirety of restored truth because of historical events about which we may not know all of the relevant information or because of awkward experiences with other Church members?” To judge wisely, consider the entirety of the gospel of Jesus Christ. </p>

                    Sin and spiritual apathy fill our souls with fertile soil where doubt can thrive uncontested. Both separate us from divine inspiration. When we sever ourselves from divine guidance, we are only left with our natural abilities to combat the supernatural powers of the adversary. Without the heavenly help provided to us by a loving God and Savior, we are doomed to fail. When it comes to finding truth, nothing in this world can compensate for a lack of divine guidance. </p>

                    If we remove ourselves from the light of the gospel, our own light begins to dim—not in a day or a week but gradually over time—until we look back and can’t quite understand why we had ever believed the gospel was true. Our previous knowledge might even seem foolish to us because what once was so clear has again become blurred, hazy, and distant. </p>

                    In moments of fear or doubt or troubling times, hold the ground you have already won, even if that ground is limited. . . . When those moments come and issues surface, the resolution of which is not immediately forthcoming, hold fast to what you already know and stand strong until additional knowledge comes. . . . The size of your faith or the degree of your knowledge is not the issue–it is the integrity you demonstrate toward the faith you do have and the truth you already know.

                    <br><br>

                    When problems come and questions arise, do not start your quest for faith by saying how much you do not have, leading as it were with your “unbelief.”. . . Let me be clear on this point: I am not asking you to pretend to faith you do not have. I am asking you to be true to the faith you do have. Sometimes we act as if an honest declaration of doubt is a higher manifestation of moral courage than is an honest declaration of faith. It is not! . . . Furthermore, you have more faith than you think you do because of what the Book of Mormon calls “the greatness of the evidences.”. . .

                    <br><br>

                    Brothers and sisters, this is a divine work in process, with the manifestations and blessings of it abounding in every direction, so please don’t hyperventilate if from time to time issues arise that need to be examined, understood, and resolved. They do and they will. In this Church, what we know will always trump what we do not know. And remember, in this world, everyone is to walk by faith. </p>

                    For some, Christ’s invitation to believe and remain continues to be hard—or difficult to accept. Some disciples struggle to understand a specific Church policy or teaching. Others find concerns in our history or in the imperfections of some members and leaders, past and present. Still others find it difficult to live a religion that requires so much. Finally, some have become “weary in well-doing.” For these and other reasons, some Church members vacillate in their faith, wondering if perhaps they should follow those who “went back, and walked no more” with Jesus.
                    <br><br>


                    If any one of you is faltering in your faith, I ask you the same question that Peter asked: “To whom shall [you] go?” If you choose to become inactive or to leave the restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where will you go? What will you do? The decision to “walk no more” with Church members and the Lord’s chosen leaders will have a long-term impact that cannot always be seen right now. There may be some doctrine, some policy, some bit of history that puts you at odds with your faith, and you may feel that the only way to resolve that inner turmoil right now is to “walk no more” with the Saints. If you live as long as I have, you will come to know that things have a way of resolving themselves. An inspired insight or revelation may shed new light on an issue. Remember, the Restoration is not an event, but it continues to unfold.

                    <br><br>

                    Never abandon the great truths revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Never stop reading, pondering, and applying the doctrine of Christ contained in the Book of Mormon. . .

                    <br><br>

                    So before you make that spiritually perilous choice to leave, I encourage you to stop and think carefully before giving up whatever it was that brought you to your testimony of the restored Church of Jesus Christ in the first place. Stop and think about what you have felt here and why you felt it. Think about the times when the Holy Ghost has borne witness to you of eternal truth. </p>

                    A sincere questioner continues to be obedient while searching for answers. By contrast, I have seen that when people doubt their beliefs, they often suspend their commitment to commandments and covenants while waiting for answers. One problem with doubt is the intent to obey only after the uncertainty is resolved to the satisfaction of the doubter. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    If you seek an answer to a spiritual question from the Source of all knowledge, then you have to follow His rules to get the answer. This process requires at least a desire to understand the truth and a willingness to follow God’s will. Otherwise, you run the risk of talking yourself into the answers you want to believe rather than receiving true answers from God.


                    <br><br>
                    It is perfectly normal to feel concern and uneasiness when confronted with an unfamiliar idea, especially if it challenges a strongly held belief. What matters is not letting that uneasiness turn us from our covenants during our search for answers. We cannot turn our back on God and then expect Him to answer our questions on our terms. It takes faith to continue keeping the commandments while our uncertainty is being resolved. It may be tempting to withhold or limit our obedience pending convincing resolution of our concerns, but this is not God’s way. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    The first step in resolving questions is to keep living the commandments, . . . You immerse yourself in the very things that helped build your core of faith: you exercise faith in Christ, you pray, you ponder the scriptures, you repent, you keep the commandments, and you serve others.

                    <br><br>

                    When faced with a trial of faith—whatever you do, don’t step away from the Church! Distancing yourself from the kingdom of God during a trial of faith is like leaving the safety of a secure storm cellar just as the tornado comes into view. </p>

                    I don't have the answers to every question I've asked or pondered. There are plenty of questions and issues I have not resolved. But as I've been willing to wrestle, sometimes for years at a time, the Lord has taught me. I've received enough enlightenment enough times to know that there is always more to learn, always greater light and knowledge available. When we are willing to wrestle spiritually for knowledge and revelation, the Spirit will enlighten us, guide us to truth, and bless us with peace of heart and mind. </p>

                    My sincere recommendation to someone wavering in the faith is to take the time and expend the effort to re-kindle the flame of faith that they spent in gaining a witness in the first place and maintaining it through the years. If you once came to know the message is true by the power of the Spirit, have you spent as much time on your knees recently, as you did then? Have you been direct, specific, and earnest in your pleadings to the same God? Do your spiritual efforts match your mental gymnastics? If it's fair game to question what you once knew to be true, it's more than fair to question your questions or doubt your doubts. I don't think I have ever met a person who chose to leave The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints whose explanation for leaving was that they had prayed about the matter and received divine direction to do so. There must be people out there who can make that claim, but I haven't met them yet. </p>

                    Am I suggesting that the questioner ignore troublesome issues or pretend that supposed contradictions do not exist? No, not at all. I am proposing, however, that to attend only to one's rational processes, to make monumental decisions of the soul on the basis alone of one's intellect---what we think we now understand---is at best unwise and at worst spiritually perilous. . . . When it comes to spiritual matters, often the heart begins to reveal things to the mind that it did not know. Very often, believing is seeing. </p>

                    My dear young friends, we are a question-asking people because we know that inquiry leads to truth. That is the way the Church got its start---from a young man who had questions. In fact, I'm not sure how one can discover truth without asking questions. </p>

                    Men and women who don't believe don't understand. People who have allowed their hearts to become hardened, who revel and even delight in cynicism, such people will forevermore fall short of what they might know and grasp, unless they repent. People who allow their questions to morph into doubts, will never understand doctrines and principles that are beautifully plain to "the weak and the simple." Those who have unanswered questions, who allow themselves to simmer in skepticism, and who eventually become hardened in their ignorance, are generally those who either chose to keep their questions to themselves, refused to admit their need for knowledge, and faced their fears alone, or instead turned in the wrong direction for help. In short, there are some people who, because of their refusal to believe, will never comprehend the truths of greatest worth. On the other hand, a boy or girl, a woman or man who has a believing heart---note, we are not speaking here of a gullible heart---will see and feel and grasp sacred matters that others whose minds are closed and whose hearts are hardened will never know. </p>

                    We tend to reinterpret the past on the basis of the present. We are creatures of the moment, so, rather than remember, we reconstruct what once we knew in the light of present uncertainty or loss, which can all too easily overwhelm what we once held as true and real. All too often we forget the gentle impressions we felt, the calm soothing of troubled hearts and minds, or even greater manifestations of divine love. </p>

                    In a sense, Thomas represents the spirit of our age. He would not be satisfied with anything he could not see, even though he had been with the Master and knew his teachings concerning faith and doubt. . . . Faith does not take precedence over doubt when one must feel or see in order to believe.

                    <br><br>

                    Thomas . . . wanted knowledge, not faith. Knowledge is related to the past because our experiences of the past are those things which give us knowledge, but faith is related to the future---to the unknown where we have not yet walked. Thomas had said, 'To see is to believe,' but Christ answered, 'To believe is to see.' </p>

                    Latter-day Saints are given the largest possible latitude for their convictions, and if a man rejects a message that I may give to him but is still moral and believes in the main principles of the gospel and desires to continue in his membership in the Church, he is permitted to remain. . . .

                    The standard of the church’s divinity is not its perfection but its ability to serve as a schoolmaster for gods in embryo. The things that may be most frustrating and perplexing may be the very means by which God is teaching us what it’s like to be him. The church is not something we merely tolerate while striving to live the true gospel or anticipating the coming kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is among us. The good news is that as we gather together in Christ’s name, however imperfectly, he is with us. </p>

                    It can be easy to feel overwhelmed by membership in the Church. Christ’s yoke may be easy and his burden light, but life in the church is sometimes anything but. There is so much to do, so many ways to fall short, so many people to disappoint, and so much that is clearly human. When members of the church or its leaders fail to live up to the values they espouse, it’s easy to question the value of maintaining our association with them. If Zion is the ideal society, then it’s immediately apparent that our local wards, and therefore the church as a whole, fall woefully short. That understanding may give us perspective and hope, but it doesn’t change the fact that staying in the boat and holding on is hard, often straining us to our very limits. </p>

                    Mormonism is wonderful in all its swirl of paradox, contradiction, and challenge. Mormonism’s whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is not reducible to either its best or worst features. It is a graced community that works out its own salvation in this world and the next. We follow the prophet and listen to our own individual conscience and stumble forward, seeing “through a glass, darkly.” </p>

                    It has been said that Jesus invented true religion, and man invented churches. That’s not exactly right, but it does reflect a crucial principle: true religion is a way of life; a church is an institution designed to strengthen people in the exercise of that life. . . .

                    What purpose then does the Church serve? We sometimes want it to be more, and sometimes less, than it is. The Church was not designed like a Swiss Army Knife, with a tool to meet every need, a program to serve every function. We often impose on the Church organization similar expectations, wanting it to fulfill purposes it was never intended to serve.

                    <br><br>

                    What if we saw the mediocre talk, the overbearing counselor, the lesson read straight from the manual, as a lay member’s equivalent of the widow’s mite? A humble offering, perhaps, but one to be measured in terms of the capacity of the giver rather than in the value received. And if the effort itself is negligible—well, then the gift is the opportunity given us to exercise patience and mercy. If that sounds too idealistic, if we insist on imposing a higher standard on our co-worshippers, if we insist on measuring our worship service in terms of what we “get out of” the meeting, then perhaps we have erred in our understanding of worship. </p>

                    The challenge, then, and the enticing opportunity, is to find a pattern of devotion and nourishment that extends beyond the confines of a Sunday curriculum, one that constitutes our private life of discipleship. The established Church provides a framework of service, an occasion for community, and a vehicle for saving ordinances, it is in the secret chambers of our private temples that we must have ultimate recourse to the inspiration and revelation that guide our discipleship. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    The Church is a place to worship, to serve others, to learn to get along with people we might not choose as neighbors or family, and to find kinship with a large and timeless community of disciples. It is a workshop for the soul. But ultimately, we are responsible for our own life of discipleship, for finding spiritual nourishment in our own sacred spaces. At the same time, we are part of the body of Christ—and we can influence the collective only if we are part of it.

                    There are certain inequities, iniquities, and injustices in this world that no amount of historicizing, contextualizing, or theologizing will satisfy. Some are so devastating that they challenge our faith in humanity and sometimes our faith in the church and even in God. As we ponder on certain controversies and conundrums, sometimes we are simply left without a good answer, either for ourselves or for those we love. These are the moments that test our hope. In our pain and disorientation, we are forced to plumb the depths of our faith, our hope, and our love—the very foundations of our Christian discipleship. At times the church itself may be both the source and the site of our struggles. . .

                    <br><br>

                    Christian discipleship has always been beset by internal and external crises that have shaken the faithful. It was true in the early Christian church; it is true today. </p>

                    Faith often asks us to turn a blind eye to the incongruities and inconsistencies of belief in the divine. . . . Whatever sense we make of this world, whatever value we place upon our lives and relationships, whatever meaning we ultimately give to our joys and agonies, must necessarily be a gesture of faith. . . .

                    <br><br>
                    The call to faith is a summons to engage the heart, to attune it to resonate in sympathy with principles and values and ideals that we devoutly hope are true and which we have reasonable but not certain grounds for believing to be true. There must be grounds for doubt as well as belief, in order to render the choice more truly a choice. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    In this world, one is always provided with sufficient materials out of which to fashion a life of credible conviction or dismissive denial. We are acted upon, in other words, by appeals to our personal values, our yearnings, our fears, our appetites, and our egos. What we choose to embrace, to be responsive to, is the purest reflection of who we are and what we love. . . .


                    <br><br>
                    The call to faith is not some test of a coy god, waiting to see if we “get it right.” It is the only summons, issued under the only conditions, which can allow us fully to reveal who we are, what we most love, and what we most devoutly desire. Without constraint, without any form of mental compulsion, the act of belief becomes the freest possible projection of what resides in our hearts. </p>

                    Saying that the church and its prophets are not perfect is not the same as saying they are not true. Just the opposite is, in fact, the case according to our understanding of our Heavenly Father’s plan. The prophets cannot be required to be perfect because that would foil the whole purpose of the plan, which is for human beings (including church leaders) to exercise moral agency. In this life we learn through our experience to distinguish good from evil and choose truth over error. If God were to dictate every decision and forcibly instigate every policy, if he refused to allow his church leaders, from prophets to Primary presidents, to ever make mistakes or commit sin, he would be defeating his own purpose: to help us learn to use our moral agency to develop our divine nature and become like he is.


                    <br><br>
                    God treats the church very much like he treats individuals. As we strive to follow him, he intervenes occasionally to provide us with guidance, to warn us from danger, or to admonish us to change direction. Much of the time, however, even for those blessed with the gift of the Holy Ghost or the mantle of prophethood, he teaches us correct principles and allows us to govern ourselves. </p>

                    How is it possible to witness or endure infelicities within an institution that claims to be God’s true church? How can God expect us to follow prophets when he knows full well that they not only preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and administer saving priesthood ordinances but also institute priesthood bans and cover up massacres? How can we possibly place our hope in imperfect human vessels such as Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and the current President of the church, not to mention our bishops and stake presidents? The answer, of course, is that we do not.

                    <br><br>

                    We do not place our ultimate hope in prophets and priesthood leaders. We do not place our ultimate hope in the church. We place our ultimate hope in Christ and his atonement. The prophets and priests of Israel, both anciently and today, enliven our hope by directing us toward the Hope of Israel. God points us to prophets and the church not because they can save or redeem us, but because they are the temporal means by which he orients us to our Savior and Redeemer. </p>

                    Not every statement made by a Church leader, past or present, necessarily constitutes doctrine. A single statement made by a single leader on a single occasion often represents a personal, though well-considered, opinion, but is not meant to be officially binding for the whole Church. With divine inspiration, the First Presidency . . . and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. . . counsel together to establish doctrine that is consistently proclaimed in official publications. This doctrine resides in the four “standard works” of scriputre. . ., official declarations and proclamations, and the Articles of Faith. Isolated statements are often taken out of context, leaving their original meaning distorted. </p>

                    A few question their faith when they find a statement made by a Church leader decades ago that seems incongruent with our doctrine. There is an important principle that governs the doctrine of the Church. The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. True principles are taught frequently and by many. Our doctrine is not difficult to find. The leaders of the Church are honest but imperfect men. . . . It should be remembered that not every statement made by a Church leader past or present necessarily constitutes doctrine. It is commonly understood in the church that a statement made by one leader on a single occasion often represents a personal, though well considered, opinion not meant to be official or binding for the whole Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that a prophet is a prophet only when he is acting as such. </p>

We seem to want a list of “do’s” and “don’ts” and a precise page number to which we can find the answer to any question or challenge we encounter. Too often, we want and expect the prophet to have all the answers, but that is not what prophets are for. Prophets, the scriptures, the Church, temples, ordinances, etc., are all tools to help us reunite with God; yet they are all imperfect tools. All humans, and all things with which humans have dealings, are imperfect. Because the tools, however, are a means to an end rather than the end themselves, the tools need not be perfect to be effective. We determine the effectiveness of the tool. . . . Not all issues fit into neat, simple, compartmentalized categories for which there are easy explanations. In life—especially with complex issues such as religion—there are ambiguities; and not all difficult issues will be resolved in our lifetimes. </p>

                    To claim that anything taught in general conference is “official” doctrine makes the place where something is said rather than what is said the standard of truth. A teaching is not automatically considered doctrine simply because it was said by someone who holds a particular office or position.

                    It makes no difference what is written or what anyone has said, if what has been said is in conflict with what the Lord has revealed, we can set it aside. My words, and the teachings of any other member of the Church, high or low, if they do not square with the revelations, we need not accept them. Let us have this matter clear. We have accepted the four standard works as the measuring yardsticks, or balances, by which we measure every man’s doctrine.

                    A consistent message of scripture seems to be that in the Zion we live in—as opposed to the Zion we aspire to and only rarely achieve—we will always find snares, stumbling blocks, and offenses. In a fallen world, scandal constantly dogs the covenant. The recurrent inability of God’s people to learn their lessons can be a bit depressing, to be sure, but overall the message is one of hope: Zion’s scandals can disappoint and disturb us without baffling or confounding us. . . . Scripture reminds us not to be surprised by Zion’s failings and to believe that God can redeem his people in spite of their many missteps. </p>

The Church is a place where imperfect people gather to provide encouragement, support, and service to each other as we press on in our journey to return to our Heavenly Father.

                    Of course, there are items in our history which, when pulled our of context and highlighted, separated from the time and the circumstances in which the events took place, may raise some questions. Remember, however, that no Church leader of whom I am aware, past or present, has ever claimed perfection. They have been and are human, including those who have served as Presidents of the Church. The Lord has always used those he has found most suitable for His purposes. Notwithstanding some human weaknesses, they have accomplished great and remarkable things, and this even while enemies have been snapping at their heels. The work has moved steadily and consistently forward, and the only losers have been those who, in a spirit of criticism, which usually has begun in a very mild and innocuous way, have in some instances literally read, talked, and written themselves out of the Church because they looked only for the negative, read only the negative, and discussed only the negative. </p>

                    We recognize that our forebears were human. They doubtless made mistakes. Some of them acknowledged making mistakes. But the mistakes were minor when compared with the marvelous work which they accomplished. To highlight mistakes and gloss over the greater good is to draw a caricature. Caricatures are amusing, but they are often ugly and dishonest. A man may have a wart on his cheek and still have a face of beauty and strength, but if the wart is emphasized unduly in relation to his other features, the portrait is lacking in integrity.

                    <br><br>

                    There was only one perfect man who ever walked the earth. The Lord has used imperfect people in the process of building his perfect society. If some of them occasionally stumbled, or if their characters may have been slightly flawed in one way or another, the wonder is the greater that they accomplished so much.

                    Some struggle with unanswered questions about things that have been done or said in the past. We openly acknowledge that in nearly 200 years of Church history—along with an uninterrupted line of inspired, honorable, and divine events—there have been some things said and done that could cause people to question.


                    <br><br>
                    Sometimes questions arise because we simply don’t have all the information and we just need a bit more patience. When the entire truth is eventually known, things that didn’t make sense to us before will be resolved to our satisfaction. Sometimes there is a difference of opinion as to what the ‘facts’ really mean. A question that creates doubt in some can, after careful investigation, build faith in others.


                    <br><br>
                    To be perfectly frank, there have been times when members or leaders in the Church have simply made mistakes. There may have been things said or done that were not in harmony with our values, principles, or doctrine.


                    <br><br>
                    I suppose the Church would be perfect only if it were run by perfect beings. God is perfect, and His doctrine is pure. But He works through us—His imperfect children—and imperfect people make mistakes. . .


                    <br><br>
                    This is the way it has always been and will be until the perfect day when Christ Himself reigns personally upon the earth.
                    <br><br>


                    It is unfortunate that some have stumbled because of mistakes made by men. But in spite of this, the eternal truth of the restored gospel found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not tarnished, diminished, or destroyed.

                    One of the primary reasons why some members of the church have become disenchanted, disappointed, or even angry in recent years is because they were never taught to expect skeletons in the closet of church history and so are shocked when they find them. . . . A person could conceivably attend a lifetime of three-hour Sunday blocks and never hear about the Mountain Meadow Massacre or discrepancies in Joseph Smith's accounts of the first vision. Church leaders, in an effort to inspire and edify the members, have often chosen to present the best possible image of the Church, both to those within and those outside our faith. It is not a matter of secret cover-ups but rather "an act of ministry."

                    <br><br>

                    Those who are disappointed that church meetings are not as intellectually stimulating or historically nuanced as university classes suffer from category confusion; they would surely not expect or appreciate a sermon from their college professor. The church is primarily concerned with preaching the gospel of Christ, not adult history education. . . . Much of our church literature and teaching, especially on Sundays, is devoted to a presentation of the gospel able to reach the widest spectrum of church membership. This is not only appropriate but beautiful and redemptive. </p>

                    One guiding principle is to consult the right kind of people. If one were eager to know more about Jesus, he or she might not be well served by confining their study to what Annas, Caiaphas, or Pontius Pilate had to say about the Savior. Peter, James, and John, along with folks like Nicodemus, Mary Magdalene, and the sisters Mary and Martha would be especially helpful in acquiring accurate inside information. If my topic was the apostle Paul, then to spend the bulk of the interview time with the Judaizers or with Nero Caesar would be foolhardy.

                    <br><br>

                    If I felt driven to gain a deeper and more personal look into Joseph Smith the man, how lopsided and skewed would be my investigation if the bulk of my information came from Alexander Campbell, E.D. Howe, John C. Bennett, or William Law. Yes, it is often helpful to know what the critics and opponents have to say, but wouldn't those who knew the person intimately well be in a better position to comment and explain things? Similarly, if someone were genuinely seeking to find solutions to their doctrinal concerns or better explanations for sensitive historical moments, why would they want to immerse themselves in the writings or conversations of counter-cult groups, Ex-Mormons for Jesus, or persons who have left Mormonism but now cannot seem to leave it alone? </p>

                    The question may remain, how does one lock onto the propositional assertions of a restored gospel that is also laden with claims about gold plates and the Book of Abraham and a male priesthood and a polygamous past and a thousand other details we may find difficult? One might focus on the message rather than the messenger. One might consider that the contingencies of history and culture and the human element will always constitute the garment in which God's world and will are clothed. And one might refuse to allow our desire for the perfect to be the enemy of the present good. Finally, we might ask ourselves, with the early disciples, "to whom else shall we go?" </p>

                    There are three levels of Mormon history. Level A, is the Sunday School version. Everything on Level A is obviously good and true and harmonious. Level B, however, is the anti-Mormon version of the same story. . . . On this level, every thing that you thought was good and true and harmonious actually turns out to be evil and false and chaotic.


                    <br><br>
                    The Church typically seeks to keep its members on Level A or, at least, feels no institutional obligation to bring them to a deeper level. Why? Because souls are lost on Level B. And though Level C might be academically more desirable, it cannot be accessed without at least some exposure to Level B. Were we in leadership positions, we would probably make the same decision.

                    <br><br>

                    Once members of the Church have been exposed to Level B, their only hope is to press on to the richer, more complicated version of history that is to be found on Level C—which, turns out to be essentially, and profoundly, like Level A. The only remedy for bad anti-Mormon arguments is better counterarguments. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Not everybody needs Level C. But some do, whether because they are troubled by Level B or because they find Level A insufficiently nourishing in some way. . . . To reach level C we must be willing to become more mature in our beliefs, attitudes, and perspectives; we must be willing to let go of idealistic fantasies, myths, and folklore; we must be willing to add cognitions or beliefs to our worldviews; and we must be open-minded enough to synthesize competing cognitions. </p>

                    There are many things in our early Church history, such as what Joseph Smith did or did not do in every circumstance, that some use as a basis for opposition. To all I say, exercise faith and put reliance on the Savior’s teaching that we should “know them by their fruits.” The Church is making great efforts to be transparent with the records we have, but after all we can publish, our members are sometimes left with basic questions that cannot be resolved by study. . . . Some things can be learned only by faith. Our ultimate reliance must be on faith in the witness we have received from the Holy Ghost. </p>

                    To reduce Mormonism to what can be explained rationally or on the grounds set by any other religion is to render it something other (and arguably less) than what it is and claims to be. Mormonism offers its own unique set of questions and answers for the world that overlaps with but is not identical to any other set of questions and answers, whether those posed by modern science or creedal Christianity. What this also means, however, is that while Mormonism is internally coherent, intellectually rewarding, spiritually satisfying, and theologically profound, when viewed solely through any other lens it will appear flawed, foolish, and even scandalous. . .

                    In Mormonism we are in the truth business. We’re not afraid of the truth, even when it is inconvenient, even when it challenges what we think we know and understand. Indeed, if we know anything in this church, it’s that God has more to teach us, so long as we don’t plug our ears and think we already know it all. </p>

                    When we drop some of our preconceived notions, do a little research, and put God and God’s work at the center of the story, we might find a redemptive narrative that is far more powerful than a denial of historical fact. . . . With that frame of mind, potentially troubling episodes in church history become poignant lessons that reveal something deeper about the way God works in the world to redeem his children. Furthermore, this approach to our history performs its own kind of redemption. </p>

                    Comprehending that faith is a process, a journey, a spectrum—choose your own metaphor—we realize that neither faith nor doubt are all-or-nothing propositions.

                    Persons with doubts often want to talk about what they think are the facts or the arguments that have caused their doubts, and about how much it hurts. They may well want to explore some scientific theory, some historical study, some political position, or some reported failures in the leaders of the Church or in its members, which they see as the source of their doubts. . . . But even at its best, the resolution of doubts by reason and appeal to evidence cannot take us far. It is helpful to meet a brilliant mind who defends gospel truths with fact and logic. There is comfort in finding that such a person has confronted the same questions with which you struggle and has retained his faith.

                    <br><br>

                    But there is a hazard. Even the most brilliant and faithful person may defend the truth with argument . . .that later proves false. The best scholarship has, at least, incompleteness in it. But even flawless argument has a weakness if you come to depend on it: What happens to the next doubt, or the next? What if no physical evidence or persuasive logic can be produced to dispel it? You will find then what I have found—that faithful scholar who reassured you with logic did not base his faith there. It was the other way around. His faith reassured him that someday, when God told him how it was done, he would see all truth as perfectly logical and transparently reasonable. </p>

                    There is inherent in educational pursuits the danger of being misled—of being so smitten by the intellectual thrill of secular learning and the lure of human reasoning that we are powerfully enticed to be suspicious of the Church, to discount or even disregard the teachings of living prophets, and to doubt the Lord and His gospel truths. “To be learned” is indeed good, but only if we “hearken unto the counsels of God” (2 Nephi 9:29).


                    <br><br>
                    The intellectual growth and mental development that results from educational pursuits is powerful. It can lead us to become experts and contributing members of society. But it can also beguile us into believing that we are so cerebrally sophisticated and rationally advanced that we no longer need religion or its naive thinking. Educational pursuits can reveal “the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness” of humans. For “when [we] are learned [we] think [we] are wise, and [we] hearken not unto the counsel of God, for [we] set it aside, supposing [we] know of [ourselves], wherefore, [our] wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth [us] not. And [we] shall perish” (2 Nephi 9:28). What an unfortunate, and, most likely, unexpected result for those who favor their intellectual prowess over God’s eternal reasoning. Compared to divine light or revelation, human logic is an unprofitable and perishable commodity. </p>

                    Our people are diligent students. They reach out after truth and knowledge with commendable zeal, and in so doing they must necessarily adopt for temporary use, many theories of men. As long, however, as they recognize them as scaffolding useful for research purposes, there can be no special harm in them. It is when these theories are settled upon as basic truth that trouble appears, and the searcher then stands in grave danger of being led hopelessly from the right way.

                    The words of the prophets cannot be held to the tentative and defective tests that men have devised for them. Science, philosophy, and common sense all have a right to their day in court. But the last word does not lie with them. Every time men in their wisdom have come forth with the last word, other words have promptly followed. The last word is a testimony of the gospel that comes only by direct revelation. Our Father in heaven speaks it, and if it were in perfect agreement with the science of today, it would surely be out of line with the science of tomorrow. Let us not, therefore, seek to hold God to the learned opinions of the moment when He speaks the language of eternity. </p>

                    First, they become comfortable with complexity and nuance. They know that in their present lives things are rarely black-and-white, and so they expect the same of the past. Situations are almost always more complex than they first appear. They may not be able to solve all problems to their full satisfaction, but they learn that problems often recede in importance with time and perspective.
                    <br><br>


                    Second, they also get comfortable with the human side of church experience. They come to see church members and 1leaders, past and present, less cardboard superhero cutouts—larger than life but two-dimensional—and more like real people. For many of them, this humanizing view of past Saints, including the prophets, actually makes them more compelling in their journey, not less. Instead of unreachable icons of piety or spirituality, they become more relatable in their humanity and therefore more suitable as actual examples of faith. People are not all good or all bad. Basically decent people make poor choices with tragic consequences, and scoundrels sometimes help old ladies across the street without stealing their purse. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    Third, they come to think differently about history itself. They become accustomed to the idea of change over time—in fact, they come to expect it. They come to see cultural and political and social context as mattering a great deal, often more than they think. They get comfortable with what history can and can’t tell them. They suspend final judgments and are content with preliminary hypotheses when the evidence is incomplete. They realize that because the past is in many ways unavailable to them in the present, studying history is less like an exact science and more a matter of argument and interpretation. They conclude, in fact, that matters as fundamentally spiritual as the prophetic calling of Joseph Smith cannot be arbitrated by history alone—especially since much of what is needed to have a truly complete historical picture is either lost or never existed.
                    <br><br>


                    Perhaps most importantly, many of them who have made peace with troubling episodes in Latter-day Saint history have come to see themselves as seekers, not unlike Joseph Smith himself. . . . They see the pursuit of truth as a lifelong endeavor. Spiritual certainty often comes piecemeal and only incrementally. They patiently gather the facts and are open to being surprised by what they find. Because the evidence is often incomplete or contradictory, they are willing to put things on the shelf for a time. . . .

                    <br><br>

                    And so we strive to find balance between patience and diligent inquiry. . . . They allow what they do not know to coexist alongside what they do know rather than allow themselves to be overwhelmed by it.

                    When we encounter information or claims that contradict the revealed word of God, our best course is to trust the word of God. Even if something seems sensible, if it conflicts with revealed truth in the scriptures or from the prophets, it is more likely than not sophistry. If we trust the Lord and His servants, what seems mysterious to us now will someday be made clear.

                    As good as our previous experience may be, if we stop asking questions, stop thinking, stop pondering, we can thwart revelations of the Spirit.

How often has the Holy Spirit tried to tell us something we needed to know but couldn’t get past the massive iron gate of what we thought we already knew? </p>

                    It’s natural to have questions—the acorn of honest inquiry has often sprouted and matured into a great oak of understanding. There are few members of the church who, at one time or another, have not wrestled with serious or sensitive questions. One of the purposes of the church is to nurture and cultivate the seed of faith—even in the sometimes sandy soil of doubt and uncertainty. Faith is to hope for things which are not seen but which are true. Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters—my dear friends—please, first doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith. We must never allow doubt to hold us prisoner and keep us from the divine love, peace, and gifts that come through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

                    I have sympathy for men and women when honest doubts enter their minds and they engage in the great conflict of resolving doubts. These doubts can be resolved, if they have an honest desire to know the truth, by exercising moral, spiritual, and mental effort. They will emerge from the conflict into a firmer, stronger, larger faith because of the struggle. They have gone from a simple, trusting faith, through doubt and conflict, into a solid substantial faith which ripens into testimony.

                    When we struggle in life for whatever reason, faith means seeking out God and inviting him more fully into our lives. Not because trials are tools we use to perfect ourselves, even if sometimes they are, but because, the purpose of life is to live in the presence of God in our fallen world. The consistent fact is that life in the presence of God, the life of faith, is better than life in the absence of God. That, after all, is the story of Adam and Eve and their bittersweet departure from the garden. Faith is not tested when what we want happens. Faith is tested when what we want does not happen. Faith is the flexibility—yearning for God’s presence—that allows us to navigate those disappointments. </p>

                    Using the term “doubt” liberally, extends its meaning well beyond its colloquial use. Such meanings include questioning, exploring, uncertainty, instability, disorientation: anything that helps make room for new discovery or promotes creative destruction. Working with the concept in this way, we find that doubt is in fact a necessary element in healthy faith, much like death makes room for new life in the natural world . . .

                    Doubt in the broadest sense is the ability to remain open, receptive, and unknowing in order to draw closer to a “pure knowledge” of Truth.</p>

                    In order for something to grow, the preceding form has to first break open. To grow as humans, we must first die to a smaller self. This is the essence of development. . . . In developmental terms, shifting from one stage to another can feel like full-blown crisis (the death of a previous self), while from another perspective it can be experienced as pure grace (the birth of a new self). . . .

                    <br><br>

                    When we view faith crisis in our church through the lens of development, we begin to see a very different picture. . . . By better recognizing the different developmental stages as potentially healthy expressions of our humanity, we can learn to enjoy the journey of growth a great deal more. . . . What we may discover is that we haven’t taken a wrong turn but have simply driven off the edge of our current map. . . .

                    For those in faith transition, for those in full-blown faith crisis, I would suggest that the question might not be whether you’re still Mormon or still have faith in the Gospel. The more inspired question may be: How might this current disorienting dilemma in your life point to a deeper faith already emerging? What in you is dying, and what is resurrecting in new form?
                    <br><br>


                    It used to be that members of our faith could go a lifetime without experiencing any significant disruption to their world views. But things have changed dramatically in not much time at all. Culture now flows along fiber optic networks, and information beams into our minds more smoothly than blood flows through our veins. And greater flow of information means greater complexity. On an unprecedented scale, members of the Church are revisiting the simpler narratives they’ve held to be true and are allowing for more nuance.

                    <br><br>

                    There are a growing number of spiritual orphans amongst us as a result—fellow Saints who have lost a sense of belonging, who feel estranged from their faith and jostled by the shifting landscape. Some seem so storm-tossed it’s as if they’ve just survived a tsunami and are sifting through the wreckage on the sand for some familiar sign of home.

                    Those of us who are American don’t always like what our elected leaders do in Washington, but not many of us choose to leave the country. We don’t always like how our family members act, but we are not going to disown them. We don’t always like our coworkers, but we don’t usually quit our jobs over that. We don’t always like all our teachers or what they teach us, but we typically stay in school until we earn our diploma. In short, we regularly recognize the limitations and flaws in the many institutions of which we are a part, but except in the case of egregious abuses we normally stay and try to make things better rather than washing our hands and walking away. While acknowledging that our church community is far from perfect, I for one have my doubts about whether there is anything much better, not only in terms of doctrinal truth and priesthood authority but also in terms of providing personal purpose, meaning, and opportunities to develop Christlike character. . .

                    <br><br>

                    It is possible to live within the church even while racked with doubts, questions, and feelings of alienation. When you run into trouble, exiting the church is not the only option. There are many benefits of staying within the community even if you are distressed by one of more of its aspects, and even if you have to renegotiate some terms. In most cases, issues can be best worked through in the company of other Saints rather than by leaving them and the church behind.

                    Staying the course takes a great effort of will. Relinquishing faith would solve some problems—but would multiply others. For how does one even begin to address the manifold experiences and tender feelings we have known, the powerful ideas and explanations our theology provides, and the visitations of peace and serenity that are balm to broken hearts like our own? Abandoning our faith because it doesn’t answer all the questions would be like closing the shutters because we can’t see the entire mountain. We know more than we think, even if we know less than we would like. </p>

                    HIS VERY NAME HAS COME to be associated with faithlessness and doubt. The story of “Doubting” Thomas is familiar but worth remembering. Thomas had every reason to doubt and to leave. His professed messiah was executed as an enemy of the state. His fellow disciples had spent the previous days quibbling over who would get the chief seats in the kingdom of heaven and then had disappeared into thin air when their master was taken. The vaunted “kingdom of God” consisted of a few hundred people, max, and now even that number seemed laughable.


                    <br><br>
                    But had Thomas set off on his own on Good Friday, when things looked so bleak and Jesus’s broken and bloodied body was being interred in the cold, hopeless tomb, had he separated himself from the company of his fellow apostles—most of whom were also more full of doubt than belief in those days—then he would never have witnessed the miraculous manifestation of the risen Christ.

                    <br><br>

                    In the moment of his greatest crisis, when he had absolutely no reason to believe and even less to stay, when it looked like everything he had lived and sacrificed for over the past three years was a complete sham, Thomas encountered Jesus, and he did so in communion with the apostles. He came to believe, spiritually, because he came, physically, to believe. It was the church, for all its early faithlessness and imperfections, which was Thomas’s salvation and ultimately the agent of God’s grace in his life and in the world. </p>

                    Sometimes the truth may just seem too straightforward, too plain, and too simple for us to fully appreciate its great value. So we set aside what we have experienced and know to be true in pursuit of more mysterious or complicated information. Hopefully we will earn that when we chase after shadows, we are pursuing matters that have little substance and value. . .

                    <br><br>

                    Are we making our discipleship too complicated? This beautiful gospel is so simple a child can grasp it, yet so profound and complex that it will take a lifetime—even an eternity—of study and discovery to fully understand it. But sometimes we take the beautiful lily of God’s truth and gild it with layer upon layer of man-made good ideas, programs, and expectations. Each one, by itself, might be helpful and appropriate for a certain time and circumstance, but when they are laid on top of each other, they can create a mountain of sediment that becomes so thick and heavy that we risk losing sight of that precious flower we once loved so dearly. . .


                    <br><br>
                    Brothers and sisters, if you ever think that the gospel isn’t working so well for you, I invite you to step back, look at your life from a higher plane, and simplify your approach to discipleship. Focus on the basic doctrines, principles, and applications of the gospel. I promise that God will guide and bless you on your path to a fulfilling life, and the gospel will definitely work better for you.

                    Knowledge matters; our minds matter. We should not turn away from facts or doctrine. The spirit quickens our minds and makes us able to see and know things that we could not otherwise know. The gospel contains many doctrines, and its history contains many facts that are marvelous and uplifting. But we need context and perspective. The facts or doctrines alone won’t save us. There is something that changes within us as we live the teachings, as we consciously choose to accept doctrines and follow them into the church community. In this model, doctrine refers largely to specific claims we might make while trying to talk about faith in God. We should be careful not to confuse doctrine and faith; they are distinct, and the distinction is that faith is a lived action made real in the world. </p>

                    Some seem to believe that faith and questions are antithetical. Such could not be further from the truth. The Restoration itself was unfolded by the proper and necessary melding of both. The Prophet Joseph Smith had both faith and questions. . . . Ours is a gospel of questions, and our lives in all of their spheres require thoughtful and appropriate inquiry if we are going to progress.

                    It is an error to assume that raising questions (or speculating) about the restored gospel leads to apostasy. If the gospel of Jesus Christ embraces all truth regardless of where it is found, then seekers will welcome the challenges and tests that come from the free exchange of ideas and beliefs. Revealed truth requires individual initiative, discussion, and decision regarding all of life’s questions. This is particularly true with regard to theological ones. . . . Activity multiplied by activity, unquestioningly doing “one’s duty” without understanding, will not reward or fulfill, nor will it sustain faith. For personal growth and development are as important as the efficient functioning of the church. The institution is a means to exaltation, never the end. </p>

                    I’ve always had an inquiring mind. I’m not satisfied just to accept things. I like to follow through and study things out. I learned early to put aside those gospel questions that I couldn’t answer. I had a shelf of things I didn’t understand, but as I’ve grown older and studied and prayed and thought about each problem, one by one I’ve been able to better understand them. [At the age of 81] I still have some questions on that shelf, but I’ve come to understand so many other things in my life that I’m willing to bide my time fo the rest of the answers. </p>

                    Disciples of Jesus Christ may not know the answers to all questions, but that does not cause us to become absorbed in an intellectual frenzy, in which searching for the answer to the unknown may become our focus to the exclusion of the many glorious truths that we do know. Rather, we are at peace with our testimony of the gospel and understand that it is all right to set aside some unanswered questions for a time because we understand that eventually all things will be revealed and understood.

Far too many things are taught or discussed or even argued about that fit into the realm of the unrevealed and thus the unresolved.

                    There is nothing in the doctrines of the Church which makes it necessary to believe that men are constantly under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, even . . . men who are high officials of the Church. When we consider the imperfections of men, their passions and prejudices, that mar the Spirit of God in them, happy is the man who can occasionally ascend to the spiritual heights of inspiration and commune with God! . . .

                    <br><br>v

                    We should recognize the fact that we do many things by our own uninspired intelligence for the issues of which we are ourselves responsible. . . He will help men at need, but I think it improper to assign every word and every act of a man to an inspiration from the Lord. Were that the case, we would have to acknowledge ourselves as being wholly taken possession of by the Lord, being neither permitted to go to the right nor the left only as he guided us. There could then be no error made, nor blunder in judgment; free agency would be taken away, and the development of human intelligence prevented. Hence, I think it a reasonable conclusion to say that constant, never varying inspiration is not a factor in the administration of the affairs of the Church; not even good men, though they be prophets or other high officials of the Church, are at all times and in all things inspired of God. It is only occasionally, and at need, that God comes to their aid. </p>

It has been like splitting hemlock knots with a corn-dodger [a piece of corn bread] for a wedge, and a pumpkin for a beetle [a wooden mallet]. Even the Saints are slow to understand. I have tried for a number of years to get the minds of the Saints prepared to receive the things of God; but we frequently see some of them, after suffering all they have for the work of God, will fly to pieces like glass as soon as anything comes that is contrary to their traditions: they cannot stand the fire at all. How many will be able to abide a celestial law, and go through and receive their exaltation, I am unable to say, as many are called, but few are chosen. </p>

Forget everything that I have said, or what President Brigham Young or President George Q. Cannon or whomsoever has said in days past that is contrary to the present revelation. We spoke with a limited understanding and without the light and knowledge that now has come into the world. We get our truth and our light line upon line and precept upon precept. We have now had added a new flood of intelligence and light on this particular subject, and it erases all the darkness, and all the views and all the thoughts of the past. They don’t matter anymore. It doesn’t make a particle of difference what anybody ever said about the [Black] matter before the first day of June of this year [1978]. It is a new day and a new arrangement, and the Lord has now given the revelation that sheds light out into the world on this subject. As to any slivers of light or any particles of darkness of the past, we forget about them. </p>

                    The fact of the matter is that we need the Church. A lack of formal organization eventually results in chaos, in every person becoming his own priest and prophet, his own scriptural interpreter. We need the fellowship of the Saints, since true Christianity is always manifest in community, in a body of believers who labor to establish Zion. We need the ordinances and the priesthood authority to administer them (the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, baptism, conferral of the gift of the Holy Ghost, ordinations, endowments, and sealings). We need the teachings and precepts that come from inspired gospel instruction and discussion, and we need the leaders of the Church, both general and local, for their oversight and direction and also for the divine power and strength that come through humbly following the counsel of those holding the keys.

                    <br><br>

                    It is inevitable in a lay church like ours, which is exactly what the first-century Christian Church was and the restored Church is, that we will come face to face with differences in point of view, oddities and peculiarities, and even serious mistakes. It is hard to imagine that as members of the restored Church we would not have occasion during a lifetime in which decisions were made with which one or another of us disagreed; in which policies or procedures were put in place that rubbed us the wrong way; in which the style of leadership of a new bishop or stake president made us uncomfortable. That comes with the turf of mortality, doesn’t it? Don’t human beings regularly see things differently quite often?

                    <br><br>

                    Our task as followers of Christ is to love and pray for and uphold our leaders, knowing full well that they have their challenges and are not perfect. We must learn to adapt to differences in administrative styles, knowing that few people on earth will operate in just the same way the previous beloved bishop or stake president did. We must learn to receive the words of our seers and revelators “in all patience and faith,” knowing that sometimes we are required to wait for a season before we understand completely why the Brethren counseled as they did. I would ask you a question: “Do you really want to belong to a church that is created in your image?” Seriously, is it even possible to conceive of a church whose leaders and decisions are in complete harmony with you one hundred percent of the time? That is highly unlikely, if not impossible. </p>

                    Life in the Church means experiencing leaders or teachers who are not always wise, mature, and deft. In too many cases we understand perfectly well what it means to be disappointed in a leader. Perhaps we have felt misunderstood, devalued, micromanaged, insulted, or criticized.

                    <br><br>

                    The list of hurts can go on and on. These hurts sting even more than typical wounds because they have come from the very leaders and teachers who were supposed to support and defend us—to stand as our heroes. Let’s face it, sometimes those in Church leadership positions are less than heroic. It happens. </p>

                    How I regret the ignorance of this people—how it floods my heart with sorrow to se so many Elders of Israel who wish everybody to come to their standard and be measured by their measure. Every man must be just so long, to fit their iron bedstead, or be cut off to the right length: if too short, he must be stretched, to fill the requirement.

                    If they see an erring brother or sister, whose course does not comport with their particular ideas of things, they conclude at once that he or she cannot be a Saint, and withdraw their fellowship, concluding that, if they are in the path of truth, others must have precisely their weight and dimensions. </p>

                    If people fail to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or abandon it because they have a few unanswered questions, then they will experience monumental losses in their lives: a loss of doctrinal truth, a loss of gospel ordinances, a loss of priesthood power, and a loss of the fruits of Christ’s Church. . . .


                    <br><br>
                    If people reject the LDS Church, it will ruin them for any other church because they know too much. . . . If people turn from the LDS Church, where will they go to learn about the restored truths of the premortal life, the nature of God as revealed in the Sacred Grove, the fulness of the Atonement, the preaching of the gospel to the dead, baptism for the dead, the three degrees of glory, and eternal families? Where will they go when they want a priesthood blessing of comfort or healing for a family member? Where will they go to find a prophet of God? They will look in vain for those doctrines and those powers and those prophets, as they are unique to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. . .
                    <br><br>


                    The historical issues, the alleged scientific claims—these are the sideshow. The center stage is the teachings, doctrines, priesthood power, and other fruits of Mormonism. I can live with some human imperfections, even among prophets of God—those are to be expected. I can live with some alleged scientific findings contrary to the Book of Mormon—time will correct those. I can live with some seeming historical anomalies—they are minor in the total landscape of truth. But I cannot live without the doctrinal truths and ordinances restored by Joseph Smith; I cannot live without the priesthood of God to bless my family; and I cannot live without knowing my wife and children are sealed to me for eternity. That is the choice we face—a few unanswered questions on one hand versus a host of doctrinal certainties and the power of God on the other. </p>

                    When we believe or say we have been offended, we usually mean we feel insulted, mistreated, snubbed, or disrespected. And certainly clumsy, embarrassing, unprincipled, and mean-spirited things do occur in our interactions with other people that would allow us to take offense. However, it ultimately is impossible for another person to offend you or to offend me. Indeed, believing that another person offended us is fundamentally false. To be offended is a choice we make; it is not a condition inflicted or imposed upon us by someone or something else. . . . To believe that someone or something can make us feel offended, angry, hurt, or bitter diminishes our moral agency and transforms us into objects to be acted upon. As agents, however, you and I have the power to act and to choose how we will respond to an offensive or hurtful situation. .

                    <br><br>

                    Understanding that the Church is a learning laboratory helps us to prepare for an inevitable reality. In some way and at some time, someone in this Church will do or say something that could be considered offensive. Such an event will surely happen to each and every one of us—and it certainly will occur more than once. Though people may not intend to injure or offend us, they nonetheless can be inconsiderate and tactless.

                    <br><br>

                    You and I cannot control the intentions or behavior of other people. However, we do determine how we will act. Please remember that you and I are agents endowed with moral agency, and we can choose not to be offended. . .

                    <br><br>

                    One of the greatest indicators of our own spiritual maturity is revealed in how we respond to the weaknesses, the inexperience, and the potentially offensive actions of others. A thing, an event, or an expression may be offensive, but you and I can choose not to be offended—and to say “it mattereth not.”</p>

                    Travel on the straight and narrow path occurs in company with other disciples, imperfect and different as we all are. Side by side, as we all are, means that there are ways in which we can become offended or even embittered. Given the imperfections of all of us in the Church, offenses will come and disappointments will occur. How we handle these is crucial.

                    In Salt Lake’s old Thirteenth Ward, Bishop Edwin D. Woolley frequently found himself at odds with President Brigham Young. On a certain occasion, as they ended one such fractious encounter, Young had a final parting remark: “Now, Bishop Woolley, I guess you will go off and apostatize.” To which the bishop rejoined, “If this were your church, President Young, I would be tempted to so. But this is just as much my church as it is yours, and why should I apostatize from my own church?” That sense of ownership, or, better, of full and equal membership in the body of Christ, was Bishop Woolley’s salvation. He wisely realized, as not all do, that forsaking the Church out of hurt or frustration would be as unprofitable as any other form of misdirected energy.

                    I had a conversation with another would-be censor of our sacred books. He accosted me on the street with the question: “Bishop Whitney, do you believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God?” “I certainly do,” said I. “Well, can’t God speak grammatically?” “Of course he can.” “Then why was this grammatical error left in the Book of Mormon?” —and he quoted it. “Do you really want to know?” “Yes,” he said. “Well, I think that was left there just to keep you out of the Church.”


                    <br><br>
                    He seemed surprised: “Doesn’t God want me in his Church?” “No,” I said; “he only wants honest seekers after truth; and if you think more of a grammatical error than you do of your soul’s salvation you are not fit for the kingdom of heaven, and the Lord doesn’t want you.”
                    <br><br>


                    He was astonished. It was something he hadn’t thought of. He felt very much as Goliath did when the stone sank into his forehead—such a thing had never entered his head before.” </p>
