    The plan of salvation is a system of faith—it begins with faith, and continues by faith; and every blessing which is obtained in relation to it is the effect of faith, and continues by faith; and every blessing which is obtained in relation to it is the effect of faith, whether it pertains to this life or that which is to come. To this all the revelations of God bear witness. Joseph Smith, Lectures on Faith, 7:17


    2
    Let us here observe, that three things are necessary in order that any rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and salvation.



    First, the idea that he actually exists.



    Second, a correct idea of his character, perfections, and attributes.



    Thirdly, an actual knowledge that the course of life which he is pursuing is according to his will. For without an acquaintance with these three important facts, the faith of every rational being must be imperfect and unproductive; but with this understanding it can become perfect and fruitful, abounding in righteousness, unto the praise and glory of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

    Joseph Smith, Lectures on Faith, 3:2-5.


    3
    Faith is the child of knowledge. It is reserved for those who first have knowledge; there neither is nor can be any faith until there is knowledge. No one can have faith in a God of whom he knows nothing. Faith is founded on truth; it is the offspring of truth; it can never exist alone and apart from the truth. Bruce R. McConkie, New Witness for the Articles of Faith, 166.


    4
    The point is not God’s unlimited power and knowledge but his purpose and love. God need only possess power and knowledge sufficient to save, exalt, and insure the eternal lives of those who trust in him. . . . Religious faith is more a function of intimacy than of ultimacy, more a product of relationships than of logical necessities. That is why faith in God makes all the difference in the world. Blake T. Ostler, “The Concept of a Finite God as an Adequate Object of Worship,” Line Upon Line, 80.


    5
    Faith is the complete trust, confidence in, and reliance upon the merits, mercy, and grace of Jesus Christ for salvation. It is a gift of the Spirit, a divine endowment that affirms to the human heart the identity and redemptive mission of the Savior. Though one might speak of faith in a broad sense as the underlying reason why people live and move and go about their daily activities, the faith of which the scriptures speak, especially the Book of Mormon, is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

    Selected Writings of Robert L. Millet, 206.


    6
    Faith is a gift of God bestowed as a reward for personal righteousness. It is always given when righteousness is present, and the greater the measure of obedience to God’s laws the greater will be the endowment of faith.

    Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, 264.


    7
    In obtaining or increasing faith, the great governing principle is personal righteousness. A man’s faith cannot exceed his righteousness and obedience. The greater the adherence to the truth, the greater is the faith of an individual.

    Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrinal New Testament Commentary, 1:525.


    8
    Faith, to be faith, must center on something that is not known. Faith, to be faith, must go beyond that for which there is confirming evidence. Faith, to be faith, must go into the unknown. Faith, to be faith, must walk to the edge of the light and then a few steps into the darkness. If everything has to be known, if everything has to be explained, if everything has to be certified, then there is no need for faith. Indeed, there is not room for it. . .



    In a world filled with skepticism and doubt, the expression “seeing is believing” promotes the attitude, “You show me, and I will believe.” We want all of the proof and all of the evidence first. It seems hard to take things on faith.



    When will we learn that in spiritual things it works the other way around—that believing is seeing? Spiritual belief precedes spiritual knowledge. When we believe in things that are not seen but are nevertheless true, then we have faith. Boyd K. Packer, Improvement Era, November 1968, 62-63


    9
    Of course one always carries his spiritual eyes with him, but they are not necessarily activated if he has not believed the Lord’s revealed paradigm. Unbelief acts as a veil, and the Lord speaks of the mind darkened by unbelief. But giving oneself wholly to the revelations in the assurance that each of them represents things-as-they-are will produce that condition where believing becomes seeing. We learn that many spiritual realities remain hidden from Man’s awareness until it is activated through belief and faith. M. Catherine Thomas, Light of the Wilderness, x.


    10
    Choosing faith requires strength, not weakness. God’s path is an uphill climb. It is the path of disbelief that always points downhill. Brad Wilcox, The Continuous Conversion, 86. 


    11
    True faith inevitably leads to action. The truest knowing comes in the doing.

    Brad Wilcox, The 7-day Christian, 14.


    12
    There are two kinds of faith. One of them functions ordinarily in the life of every soul. It is the kind of faith born by experience; it gives us certainty that a new day will dawn, that spring will come. . . . There is another kind of faith, rare indeed. This kind of faith that causes things to happen. It is the kind of faith that is worthy and prepared and unyielding, and it calls forth things that otherwise would not be. It is the kind of faith that moves people. It is the kind of faith that sometimes moves things. Few men possess it. It comes by gradual growth. It is a marvelous, even a transcendent, power, a power as real and as invisible as electricity. Directed and channeled, it has great effect. Boyd K. Packer, Faith, 42-43.


    13
    Such simple acts of faith as studying the scriptures daily, fasting regularly, and praying with real intent deepen our well of spiritual capacity to meet the demands of mortality. Over time, simple habits of belief lead to miraculous results. They transform our faith from a seedling into a dynamic power for good in our lives. . .



    Those who are deliberate about doing the “small and simple things” —obeying in seemingly little ways—are blessed with faith and strength that go far beyond the actual acts of obedience themselves and, in fact, may seem totally unrelated to them. It may seem hard to draw a connection between the basic daily acts of obedience and solutions to the big, complicated problems we face. But they are related. Getting the little daily habits of faith right is the single best way to fortify ourselves against the troubles of life, whatever they may be. Small acts of faith, even when they seem insignificant or entirely disconnected from the specific problems that vex us, bless us in all we do. . . . The trial of our faith will always involve staying true to simple, daily practices of faith. L. Whitney Clayton, “Whatsoever He Saith unto You, Do it,” Ensign, May 2017, 97-99.


    14
    As I think about faith, this principle of power, I am obliged to believe that it is an intelligent force. Of what kind, I do not know. But it is superior to and overrules all other forces of which we know. . . . We have had this great power given unto us, this power of faith. What are we doing about it? Can we do the mighty things that the Savior did? Yes. They have been done by the members of the Church who had the Faith and the righteousness so to do. Think of what is within your power if you but live the Gospel, if you but live so that you may invoke the power which is within you. J. Reuben Clark, C.R. April, 1960, 21.


    15
    This intelligent force in a spiritually developed being can be channeled to bring things to pass. We might consider that Faith is the power to set holy spirit in motion. M. Catherine Thomas, Light in the Wilderness, 254.


    16
    Faith is spiritual; it comes from the Lord. But it is actuated by you. . . . When the Brother of Jared saw the Lord, was it because the Lord said, “Well, he is a pretty good man. I guess I will just show myself to him?” No, the Brother of Jared learned a law and obeyed it. . . . I think often the Lord says, “Don’t ask me to do it—you do it.” . . . If you were dependent on the Lord to do all of the work, which is what Satan wanted and still wants, you would be a puppet on a string. But because of the great love of the Lord, he says, “I will give you some of my power until you learn to act independently, just as I do, if you will do my will. And if you will, I will eventually give you all my power.”



    Somehow the Latter-day Saints have the mistaken notion that in the end, when the day comes that the Lord will make them gods or goddesses, when someone lays their hands on their heads and, as it were, says to them, You have now all that you need to be a God—go ahead—this is not true. All that you need to be a God is in you right now. Your job is to take those crude elements within you and refine them. . . . In other words, the Lord is saying, Take the reins. Take charge under the direction of my Spirit. Don’t wait for someone to tell you everything to do. . . . You prevail over people, things, and situations by your faith. Gene R. Cook, Living by the Power of Faith, 89-92.


    17
    True faith combines belief and action in an inseparable partnership that invites God’s power into our lives. Belief, action, power—these are the indispensable elements of faith . . . . On the other hand, false faith is a token confession, a mere mouthing of the words, a superficial belief in Jesus Christ that does not lead to action or discipleship. It may be found in the person who professes a faith in Christ but fails to live His teachings. It is passive in its nature . . . .



    True faith always motivates its possessor to action. Tad R. Callister, The Blueprint of Christ’s Church, 127-128.


    18
    The Plan of Salvation itself is a system of faith—it begins with faith and continues by faith. To produce salvation, Faith develops from its slender beginnings as belief, progresses through obedience, and becomes an actual power to shape people and events. Faith’s primary role is to produce a person who can be exalted and take his place among the Gods.

    M. Catherine Thomas, Light in the Wilderness, 257. 


    19
    The purpose of faith is not to change God’s will but to empower us to act on God’s will. Faith is trust—trust that God sees what we cannot and that He knows what we do not. Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Fourth Floor, Last Door,” Ensign, November 2016, 23.


    20
    To have Faith in Christ means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him.

    C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity, 131.


    21
    To suppose there can be faith in Christ without faithfulness to Christ is a contradiction in terms.

    Robert L. Millet, The Holy Ghost, 155. .


    22
    True faith is always manifest in faithfulness, obedience, and dedicated discipleship. Robert L. Millet, The Atoning One, 159.


    23
    Faith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your changing moods. C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity, 125


    24
    Fear and doubt preclude the possibility of the exercise of faith in God for life and salvation.

    Joseph Smith, Lectures on Faith, 4:13.


    25
    First doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith. We must never allow doubt to hold us prisoner and keep us from the divine love, peace, and gifts that come through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Come, Join With Us,” Ensign, November 2013, 23.


    26
    Whereas doubt destroys, faith fulfills. It brings one closer to God and to His purposes. Teachings of Thomas S. Monson, 108.


    27
    We cannot develop faith without destroying doubt. Fortunately, the Lord is patient and merciful with us. He knows that the acquisition and strength of our faith is a lifelong process. There may be a mixture of faith and doubts along the way, but with time and effort the doubts can be eliminated and the faith perfected. Tad R. Callister, The Blueprint of Christ’s Church, 129.


    28
    When you’re involved in the work of the Lord, the power behind you is always greater than the obstacles before you. Dallin H. Oaks,”Hastening the Work in Europe,” video on www.lds.org.


    29
    True faith is not just knowing God can, but knowing why sometimes He doesn’t. True faith is not just believing that things can work out perfectly, but trusting when sometimes they don’t. True faith is not just receiving your answer, but accepting His. Brad Wilcox, The Continuous Conversion, 39.


    30
    Faith is not bravado, not just a wish, not just a hope. True faith is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ---confidence and trust in Jesus Christ that leads a person to follow Him. . . . Faith is more than mental assent, more than an acknowledgement that God lives. Faith is total trust in Him. Faith is believing that although we do not understand all things, He does. Faith is knowing that although our power is limited, His is not. Faith in Jesus Christ consists of complete reliance on Him. Dennis E. Simmons, "But If Not . . .," Ensign, May 2004, 23.


    31
    Defining a miracle as a beneficial event brought about through divine power that mortals do not understand gives an expanded perspective into matters more eternal in nature. This definition also allows us to contemplate the vital role of faith in the receipt of a miracle. Donald L. Hallstrom, "Has the Day of Miracles Ceased?," Ensign, November 2017, 89.


    32
    What we already know about God teaches us to trust him for what we do not know fully.

    Neal A. Maxwell, Deposition of a Disciple, 56.


    33
    Faith is simply trust in what the spirit learned aeons ago. Truman G. Madsen, “On How We Know,” BYU Devotional, September 1994.


    34
    Faith in God includes faith in His timing. Neal A. Maxwell, “The Holy Ghost: Glorifying Christ,” Ensign, July 2002.


    35
    God’s delays are not always denials. Anonymous.


    36
    In the Church we ask for faith, not infallibility. Jeffrey R. Holland, However Long and Hard the Road, 9.


    37
    Faith is not only a feeling; it is a decision. With prayer, study, obedience, and covenants, we build and fortify our faith. Our conviction of the Savior and His latter-day work becomes the powerful lens through which we judge all else. Then, as we find ourselves in the crucible of life, . . . we have the strength to take the right course. Neil L. Andersen, “It’s True, Isn’t It? Then What Else Matters?,” Ensign, May 2007, 73-74.


    38
    Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is not something ethereal, floating loosely in the air. Faith does not fall upon us by chance or stay with us by birthright. Faith in Jesus Christ is a gift from heaven that comes as we choose to believe and as we seek it and hold on to it. Your faith is either growing stronger or becoming weaker. . . . The future of your faith is not by chance, but by choice. . . . Faith never demands an answer to every question but seeks the assurance and courage to move forward, sometimes acknowledging, 'I don't know everything, but I do know enough to continue on the path of discipleship.' Neil L. Andersen, "Faith is not by Chance, but by Choice," Ensign, November 2015, 65-66.


    39
    Faith is not whimpering acquiescence, not timid and spineless hope for happiness. Faith is active. Faith is powerful. Faith is based on evidence, the kind of evidence that men and women acquire who search and pray and open themselves to the Infinite, who refuse to yield to cynicism or arrogance. Robert L. Millet, Whatever Happened to Faith?, 88.


    40
    Faith is not just a belief, not just a sentiment. It is also an action, a behavior. Robert L. Millet, Whatever Happened to Faith?, 99.


    41
    Faith is more like being loyal to your husband or wife than it is like believing in magic. Adam Miller, Letters to a Young Mormon, 28.


    42
    Act as if the whole thing, the gospel, the Good News, the reality and love of God as revealed by Christ---act as if it were all true. Never mind if you have doubts, never mind if you feel it's all too good to be true. Act as if it were so. Behave as if you believed! This isn't self-deception; it's just another spiritual experiment. Samuel Shoemaker, In Gordon, Wonder, 130-131.


    43
    Faith is basically the resolve, to live our lives on the assumption that certain things are true and trustworthy. And that one day we will know with absolute certainty that they are true and trustworthy. Alister McGrath, Doubting: Growing Through the Uncertainties of Faith, IVP Books, 2006.


    44
    It was not raining when Noah was commanded to build an ark. Two Heavenly Personages were not yet seen when Joseph knelt and prayed. There was no visible ram in the thicket when Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac. First came the test of faith, and then the miracle.



    Remember that faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other. Cast out doubt. Cultivate faith. Strive always to retain that childlike faith which can move mountains and bring heaven closer to heart and home. Teachings of Thomas S. Monson, 108.

    Faith is lived, not thought. Terryl L. Givens, The Crucible of Doubt, 143.


    48
    We choose what we will believe in and live by. We choose how we will behave and what we will hope for.

    Terryl L. Givens, The Crucible of Doubt, 105.


    49
    Be of good cheer. The future is as bright as your faith. Thomas S. Monson, “Be of Good Cheer,” Ensign, May 2009, 92.


    50
    In the geometry of restored theology, hope has a greater circumference than faith. If faith increases, the perimeter of hope stretches correspondingly. Neal A. Maxwell, "Brightness of Hope," Ensign, November 1994.

    Hope is the feeling - Faith is the action. Anonymous.

    There is no medicine like hope, no incentive so great, and no tonic so powerful as expectation of something better tomorrow. Orison Marden. 


    Charity/Love

    Charity is the greatest of all the gifts of God, because it is the greatest in helping us become like God. Anthony Sweat, Christ in Every Hour, 130.

    Truman G. Madsen, The Truman G. Madsen Story, 340.

    56
    Only the comprehension of the true Fatherhood of God can bring full appreciation of the true brotherhood of a man. That understanding inspires desire to build bridges of cooperation instead of walls of segregation. Russell M. Nelson, "Teach Us Tolerance and Love," Ensign, May 1994, 70.


    57
    An important measure of our progress in coming to Christ is to be found in how well we treat others, especially those who are different. Marlin K. Jensen, "Those Who Are Different," Ensign, August 2010, 44-46.


    58
    Truly loving others requires the ongoing practice of accepting the best efforts of people whose life experiences and limitations we may never fully know. W. Craig Zwick, "That My Eyes May Be Opened," Ensign, November 2017, 98.


    59
    When our vertical relationship with God is intact, our horizontal relationship with God's children will be enhanced and magnified, and the Lord's pure love will flow spontaneously and freely. This is one of the ways that you and I begin to access the divine powers of the Lord Jesus. Russell M. Nelson, "Drawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives," Ensign, May 2017, 42.


    60
    Love is a product of what we put into a relationship. Terryl L. Givens, The Crucible of Doubt, 44.


    61
    The genuine work of love is always a hidden work. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, The Cost of Discipleship, 159.


    62
    A man’s wealth consists in the number of people he loves and blesses, and who love and bless him in return.

    Heber J. Grant, The Presidents of the Church, 205.


    63
    Marriage is the school of love. Martin Luther.


    64
    True love is not so much a matter of romance as it is a matter of anxious concern for the well being of one’s companion. Gordon B. Hinckley, “Except the Lord Build the House … ,” Ensign, June 1971, 71.


    65
    Be so close to those you love that when they weep you taste salt. Truman G. Madsen, The Radiant Life, 127.

    Our circle of friends, family, work associates is our treasure, because they provide a container in which we practice virtue. M. Catherine Thomas, Light in the Wilderness, 101.

    There isn’t time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that. Mark Twain.


    71
    From the standpoint of daily life, there is one thing we do know; that we are here for the sake of each other.

    Albert Einstein.


    72
    Friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of ‘Mormonism.’ . . . A man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race. TPJS, 316, 174.


    73
    The nearer we get to our Father in Heaven, the more we are disposed to look with compassion on perishing souls; we feel that we want to take them upon our shoulders, and cast their sins behind our backs. TPJS, 241.


    74
    A member of the Church is to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to provide for the widow, to dry up the tear of the orphan, to comfort the afflicted, whether in this church, or in any other, or in no church at all, wherever he finds them.

    Joseph Smith, Times and Seasons, March 15, 1842, 732.


    75
    When you get the spirit of God, you feel full of kindness, charity and longsuffering, and you are willing all the day long to accord to every man that which you want yourself. You feel disposed all the day long to do unto all men as you would wish them to do unto you. John Taylor, Teachings of Presidents of the Church Series, 21.


    76
    I would be a friend to the friendless and find joy in ministering to the needs of the poor. George Albert Smith, The Presidents of the Church, 221.


    77
    We hear the words of the Lord most often by a feeling. If we are humble and sensitive, the Lord will prompt us through our feelings. That is why spiritual promptings move us on occasion to great joy, sometimes to tears. . .The Holy Ghost causes our feelings to be more tender. We feel more charitable and compassionate. We are calmer. We have a greater capacity to love. People want to be around us because our very countenances radiate the influence of the Spirit.

    Ezra Taft Benson, Come unto Christ, 20.


    78
    Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can. Dalai Lama. 


    79
    I love the man better who swears a stream as long as my arm yet deals justice to his neighbors and mercifully deals his substance to the poor, than the long smooth-faced hypocrite. TPJS, 303.

    Until we have perfect love we are liable to fall. TPJS, 9. 


    83
    I know of no disease as dangerous as that commonly known as the ‘big head.’ When persons get this they have lost the spirit of God. Heber J. Grant, The Presidents of the Church, 203.


    84
    Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man... It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. Once the element of competition is gone, pride is gone.

    C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity, 110.


    85
    As long as you are proud you cannot know God. A proud man is always looking down on things and people: and, of course, as long as you are looking down you cannot see something that is above you. C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity, 111.

    Narcissism is the enemy of discipleship, self-adoration the antithesis of charity. Patrick Q. Mason, Planted, Belief and Belonging in an Age of Doubt, 175.


    89
    The proud read by the lamp of their own conceit. There is such a thing as intellectual narcissism—to be in love, as it were, with your own words and your own brilliance. Harold B. Lee, C.R., April 1966, 68.


    90
    It’s a wonderful thing to be humble. But, do not be proud of your humility. Harold B. Lee, The Presidents of the Church, 304.


    91
    God does not love us if we change, God loves us so that we can change. Only love effects true inner transformation, not duress, guilt, shunning, or social pressure. Love is not love unless it is totally free. Grace is not grace unless it is totally free. Richard Rohr, Breathing Underwater, 41.


    92
    The Bible tells us that “God is love.” He is the perfect embodiment of love, and we rely heavily on the constancy and universal reach of that love. . . . There are many ways to describe and speak of divine love. One of the terms we hear often today is that God’s love is “unconditional.” While in one sense that is true, the descriptor unconditional appears nowhere in scripture. Rather, His love is described in scripture as “great and wonderful love,” “perfect love,” “redeeming love,” and “everlasting love.” These are better terms because the word unconditional can convey mistaken impressions about divine love, such as, God tolerates and excuses anything we do because His love is unconditional, or God makes no demands upon us because His love is unconditional, or all are saved in the heavenly kingdom of God because His love is unconditional. God’s love is infinite and it will endure forever, but what it means for each of us depends on how we respond to His love. . .



    God will always love us, but He cannot save us in our sins. . . . Repentance, then, is His gift to us, purchased at a very dear price. . . . God’s greater blessings are conditioned on obedience. D. Todd Christofferson, “Abide in My Love,” Ensign, November 2016, 48-49. 


    Service

    93
    In the service of the Lord, it is not where you serve but how. J. Reuben Clark, CR, April 1951, 154.


    94
    It isn’t the badge of office we wear, it’s the service we render that counts in the Lord’s Ledger. Anonymous.


    95
    It's service, not status, that counts. Neal A. Maxwell, "It's Service, Not Status, That Counts," Ensign, July 1975.


    96
    Positions don't exalt; service does. Melvin J. Ballard


    97
    Whom the Lord calls, the Lord qualifies. Harold B. Lee, "Who Honors God, God Honors," Ensign, November 1995, 50.


    98
    A priesthood office is bestowed not for status but for service. M. Russell Ballard, "The Greater Priesthood," Ensign, September 1992, 71.


    99
    Those who have entered a covenant with Christ and seek to emulate his example know the opportunities for service are endless. Lloyd D. Newell, "Called to Serve for a Season," Religious Educator, Vol. II (3), 2010, 225-232.

    You are the gift. Sharon Eubank, 2017 BYU Forum.


    103
    God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other. Spencer W. Kimball, “Small Acts of Service,” Ensign, Dec. 1974, 2.


    104
    Each of us as a disciple of the Master has a responsibility to minister to others and recognize that what we do truly matters, even if what we do may seem small or inconsequential. Joseph B. Wirthlin, "Concern for the One," Ensign, May 2008, 17.


    105
    Any call to serve the Savior in any capacity is an invitation to learn about the principle of one by one, because that was the pattern of His service. His work is focused first, foremost, and always upon serving people---not directing programs. Ministering and blessing are His work---not simply managing His Church as an organization. The scriptures are replete with examples of the Savior ministering to individuals. In fact, most recorded accounts of the Lord's mortal ministry are focused upon His teaching and blessing people one by one. David A. Bednar, One by One, 6-7.


    106
    We must look after the individual. Christ always spoke of individuals. He healed the sick, individually. He spoke in His parables of individuals. This Church is concerned with individuals, notwithstanding our numbers. Whether they be 6 or 10 or 12 or 50 million, we must never lose sight of the fact that the individual is the important thing. Gordon B. Hinkley, Teachings of Presidents of the Church, 298.


    107
    Sadly, in today's world, a person's importance is often judged by the size of the audience before which he or she performs. That is how media and sports programs are rated, how corporate prominence is sometimes determined, and often how governmental rank is obtained. That may be why roles such as father, mother, and missionary seldom receive standing ovations. Fathers, mothers, and missionaries 'play' before very small audiences. Yet, in the eyes of the Lord, there may be only one size of audience that is of lasting importance---and that is just one. M. Russell Ballard, "The Atonement and the Value of One Soul," Ensign, May 2004, 87.


    108
    It is important to understand that the Savior does not send only General Authorities, general auxiliary leaders, stake presidents, bishops, Relief Society presidents, and other auxiliary leaders to minister single-handedly to the needs of every member in all units of His restored Church. Rather, He invites all Latter-day Saints---wherever we may live and in whatever capacity or calling we may serve---to fulfill important responsibilities and roles in the great work of the ministry. David A. Bednar, One by One, 11.


    109
    May the real meaning of the gospel distill into our hearts that we may realize that our lives, given us by God our Father, are to be used in the service of others. If we will give such service, our days will be filled with joy and gladness.

    Gordon B. Hinkley, “Giving Ourselves to the Service of the Lord,” Ensign, March 1987, 5.


    110
    Unless we lose ourselves in service to others, there is little purpose to our own lives. Those who live only for themselves eventually shrivel up and figuratively lose their lives, while those who lose themselves in service to others grow and flourish---and in effect save their lives. Thomas S. Monson, "What Have I Done for Someone Today?" Ensign, November 2009, 85.


    111
    For many years there was a sign on the wall of a shoe repair shop I patronized. It read, “I complained because I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no feet.” The most effective medicine for the sickness of self-pity is to lose ourselves in the service of others. Gordon B. Hinkley, “Whosoever Will Save His Life,” Ensign, August 1982, 5.


    112
    The best antidote I know for worry is work. The best medicine for despair is service. The best cure for weariness is the challenge of helping someone who is even more tired. Gordon B. Hinkley, “To Single Adults,” Ensign, June 1989, 75.


    113
    As we look with love and gratitude to God, as we serve him with an eye single to his glory, there goes from us the darkness of sin, the darkness of selfishness, the darkness of pride. There will come an increased love for our Eternal Father and for his Beloved Son, our Savior and our Redeemer. There will come a greater sense of service toward our fellow men, less of thinking of self and more of reaching out to others. Gordon B. Hinkley, “And the Greatest of These is Love,” Ensign, March 1984, 5. 


    114
    Often, the answer to our prayer does not come while we’re on our knees but while we’re on our feet serving the Lord and serving those around us. Selfless acts of service and consecration refine our spirits, remove the scales from our spiritual eyes, and open the windows of heaven. By becoming the answer to someone’s prayer, we often find the answer to our own. Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Your Potential, Your Privilege,” Ensign, May 2011, 76.


    115
    God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our availability, and if we then prove our dependability, he will increase our capability. Neal A. Maxwell, “It’s Service, Not Status, That Counts,” Ensign, July 1975, 7.


    116
    The root of both psychological and spiritual sickness is preoccupation with self. Ironically, the believer who is consumed with his own problems—even his own spiritual problems—to the exclusion of concern for other believers, suffers from a destructive self-centeredness that not only is the cause of, but is the supreme barrier to the solution of, his own problems. John MacArthur, The MacArthur New Testament Commentary, 383.


    117
    Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made. Marion G. Romney, “The Celestial Nature of Self- reliance,” Ensign, November 1982, 93.


    118
    Humility is the realization of our total dependence on God. . . .The instant we are able to totally acknowledge, accept, and believe that everything we have, are, or ever will be is a gift from God, then humility begins to silently and inconspicuously creep into our hearts. We will never recognize it, because we are too busy being grateful for the fact that we depend totally, solely, and completely on our Father in Heaven and the blessings he pours out upon us.

    Hyrum W. Smith, Pain is Inevitable, Misery is Optional, 47.

    Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it is thinking of yourself less. Anonymous.

    The last thing many believers need today is to go to another Bible study. They already know far more than they are putting into practice. What they need are serving experiences in which they can exercise their spiritual muscles.



    Serving is the opposite of our natural inclination. Most of the time we’re more interested in “serve us” that service. We say, “I’m looking for a church that meets my needs and blesses me,” not “I’m looking for a place to serve and be a blessing.” We expect others to serve us, not vice versa. But as we mature in Christ, the focus of our lives should increasingly shift to living a life of service. The mature follower of Jesus stops asking, “Who’s going to meet my needs?” and starts asking, “Whose needs can I meet?” Richard Werner, The Purpose-Driven Life, 231.


    127
    The only way given in heaven and upon earth whereby a man may be sanctified is in the service of others. Every requirement that God’s plan for our salvation places upon us is based in the giving of ourselves. Having the spirit of selflessness, men and women share themselves, their talents, and their means in benevolent service to mankind and God. Their reward is the freeing of their soul, the growth of their love, nearness to Divinity, and worthiness for the companionship of the Spirit. William R. Bradford, Selflessness Versus Selfishness, BYU Devotional, June 3, 2003.


    128
    One can never tell what will be the result of faithful service rendered, nor do we know when it will come back to us or to those with whom we are associated. The reward may not come at the time, but in dividends later. I believe we will never lose anything in life by giving service, by making sacrifices, and doing the right thing. Heber J. Grant, Gospel Standards, 356. 


    129
    Let us not forget the obligation which rests upon us to render allegiance and service to the Lord, and that acceptable service to Him cannot be rendered without service to our fellow man. Heber J. Grant, Messages of the First Presidency, 5:223.


    130
    As the Savior’s latter-day disciples, we come unto Him by loving and serving God’s children. As we do, we may not be able to avoid tribulation, affliction, and suffering in the flesh, but we will suffer less spiritually. Even in our trials we can experience joy and peace. Robert D. Hales, “Come, Follow Me,” Ensign, November 2016, 22-23.


    131
    I have always been furiously active in the Church, but I have. . .never held an office or rank in anything. I have undertaken many assignments given me by the leaders of the Church, and much of the work has been anonymous. No rank, no recognition, no anything. While I have been commended for some things, they were never the things which I considered most important—that was entirely a little understanding between me and my Heavenly Father, which I have thoroughly enjoyed, though no one else knows anything about it. Hugh Nibley, Dialogue, Vol. 8, no.1, 75.


    132
    The most important work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes.

    The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, 280.


    133
    No other success can compensate for failure in the home. David O. McKay, CR, Apr. 1935, 116.


    134
    On your journey back to Heavenly Father you will soon realize that this journey isn't just about focusing on your own life. No, this path inevitably leads you to become a blessing in the lives of God's other children---your brothers and sisters. And the interesting thing about the journey is that as you serve God, and as you care for and help your fellowmen, you will see great progress in your own life, in ways you could never imagine.



    Perhaps you don't consider yourself all that useful; perhaps you don't consider yourself a blessing in somebody's life. Often, when we look at ourselves, we see only our limitations and deficiencies. We might think we have to be "more" of something for God to use us---more intelligent, more wealthy, more charismatic, more talented, more spiritual. Blessings will come not so much because of your abilities but because of your choices. And the God of the universe will work within and through you, magnifying your humble efforts for His purposes. . . .



    Those who love and serve God and fellowmen and humbly and actively participate in His work will see wondrous things happen in their lives and in the lives of those they love. . . . No matter your position in your community or in the Church, God will use you, if you are willing. He will magnify your righteous desires and turn the compassionate actions you sow into a bountiful harvest of goodness. Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "A Yearning for Home," Ensign, November 2017, 23-24.

    The following is a statement by President David O. McKay given in 1965 in President McKay’s Hotel Utah apartment to a group of brethren working in the physical facilities part of the church. While engaged in explaining to them the importance of the work they were engaged in, he paused and told them the following: “Let me assure you brethren, that some day you will have a personal priesthood interview the Savior himself. If you are interested, I will tell you the order in which he will ask you to account for your earthly responsibilities,



    * First, He will request an accountability report about your relationship with your wife. Have you actively been engaged in making her happy and ensuring that her needs have been met as an individual?



    * Second, He will want an accountability report about each of your children individually. He will not attempt to have this for simply a family stewardship, but will request information about your relationship to each and every child.



    * Third, He will want to know what you have personally done with the talents you were given in the pre-existence.

    * Fourth, He will want a summary of your activity in your church assignments. He will not necessarily be interested in what assignments you have had, for in his eyes the home teacher and a mission president are probably equals, but He will request a summary of how you have been of service to your fellow man in your church assignments.



    * Fifth, He will have no interest in how you earned your living, but if you were honest in all your dealings.



    * Sixth, He will ask for an accountability on what you have done to contribute in a positive manner to your community, state, country, and the world. David O. McKay, 1965.



    In June of 1965, a group of brethren in the Physical Facilities Department of the Church was doing some work outside the Hotel Utah apartment of President David O. McKay. As President McKay stopped to explain to them the importance of the work in which they were engaged, he paused and told them the following.



    From the notes of Fred A. Baker, Managing Director, Department of Physical Facilities. Quoted by Robert D. Hales, Presiding Bishop of the Church, at a BYU Devotional assembly, March 15, 1988
