                    The plan of salvation is a system of faith—it begins with faith, and continues by faith; and every blessing which is obtained in relation to it is the effect of faith, and continues by faith; and every blessing which is obtained in relation to it is the effect of faith, whether it pertains to this life or that which is to come. To this all the revelations of God bear witness. </p>

                    Let us here observe, that three things are necessary in order that any rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and salvation.

                    <br><br>

                    First, the idea that he actually exists.

                    <br><br>

                    Second, a correct idea of his character, perfections, and attributes.
                    <br><br>


                    Thirdly, an actual knowledge that the course of life which he is pursuing is according to his will. For without an acquaintance with these three important facts, the faith of every rational being must be imperfect and unproductive; but with this understanding it can become perfect and fruitful, abounding in righteousness, unto the praise and glory of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

                    Faith is the child of knowledge. It is reserved for those who first have knowledge; there neither is nor can be any faith until there is knowledge. No one can have faith in a God of whom he knows nothing. Faith is founded on truth; it is the offspring of truth; it can never exist alone and apart from the truth. </p>

                    The point is not God’s unlimited power and knowledge but his purpose and love. God need only possess power and knowledge sufficient to save, exalt, and insure the eternal lives of those who trust in him. . . . Religious faith is more a function of intimacy than of ultimacy, more a product of relationships than of logical necessities. That is why faith in God makes all the difference in the world. </p>

                    Faith is the complete trust, confidence in, and reliance upon the merits, mercy, and grace of Jesus Christ for salvation. It is a gift of the Spirit, a divine endowment that affirms to the human heart the identity and redemptive mission of the Savior. Though one might speak of faith in a broad sense as the underlying reason why people live and move and go about their daily activities, the faith of which the scriptures speak, especially the Book of Mormon, is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

                    Faith is a gift of God bestowed as a reward for personal righteousness. It is always given when righteousness is present, and the greater the measure of obedience to God’s laws the greater will be the endowment of faith.

                    In obtaining or increasing faith, the great governing principle is personal righteousness. A man’s faith cannot exceed his righteousness and obedience. The greater the adherence to the truth, the greater is the faith of an individual.

                    Faith, to be faith, must center on something that is not known. Faith, to be faith, must go beyond that for which there is confirming evidence. Faith, to be faith, must go into the unknown. Faith, to be faith, must walk to the edge of the light and then a few steps into the darkness. If everything has to be known, if everything has to be explained, if everything has to be certified, then there is no need for faith. Indeed, there is not room for it. . .
                    <br><br>


                    In a world filled with skepticism and doubt, the expression “seeing is believing” promotes the attitude, “You show me, and I will believe.” We want all of the proof and all of the evidence first. It seems hard to take things on faith.

                    <br><br>

                    When will we learn that in spiritual things it works the other way around—that believing is seeing? Spiritual belief precedes spiritual knowledge. When we believe in things that are not seen but are nevertheless true, then we have faith. </p>

                    Of course one always carries his spiritual eyes with him, but they are not necessarily activated if he has not believed the Lord’s revealed paradigm. Unbelief acts as a veil, and the Lord speaks of the mind darkened by unbelief. But giving oneself wholly to the revelations in the assurance that each of them represents things-as-they-are will produce that condition where believing becomes seeing. We learn that many spiritual realities remain hidden from Man’s awareness until it is activated through belief and faith. </p>

                    There are two kinds of faith. One of them functions ordinarily in the life of every soul. It is the kind of faith born by experience; it gives us certainty that a new day will dawn, that spring will come. . . . There is another kind of faith, rare indeed. This kind of faith that causes things to happen. It is the kind of faith that is worthy and prepared and unyielding, and it calls forth things that otherwise would not be. It is the kind of faith that moves people. It is the kind of faith that sometimes moves things. Few men possess it. It comes by gradual growth. It is a marvelous, even a transcendent, power, a power as real and as invisible as electricity. Directed and channeled, it has great effect. </p>

                    Such simple acts of faith as studying the scriptures daily, fasting regularly, and praying with real intent deepen our well of spiritual capacity to meet the demands of mortality. Over time, simple habits of belief lead to miraculous results. They transform our faith from a seedling into a dynamic power for good in our lives. . .
                    <br><br>


                    Those who are deliberate about doing the “small and simple things” —obeying in seemingly little ways—are blessed with faith and strength that go far beyond the actual acts of obedience themselves and, in fact, may seem totally unrelated to them. It may seem hard to draw a connection between the basic daily acts of obedience and solutions to the big, complicated problems we face. But they are related. Getting the little daily habits of faith right is the single best way to fortify ourselves against the troubles of life, whatever they may be. Small acts of faith, even when they seem insignificant or entirely disconnected from the specific problems that vex us, bless us in all we do. . . . The trial of our faith will always involve staying true to simple, daily practices of faith. </p>

                    As I think about faith, this principle of power, I am obliged to believe that it is an intelligent force. Of what kind, I do not know. But it is superior to and overrules all other forces of which we know. . . . We have had this great power given unto us, this power of faith. What are we doing about it? Can we do the mighty things that the Savior did? Yes. They have been done by the members of the Church who had the Faith and the righteousness so to do. Think of what is within your power if you but live the Gospel, if you but live so that you may invoke the power which is within you. </p>

                    Faith is spiritual; it comes from the Lord. But it is actuated by you. . . . When the Brother of Jared saw the Lord, was it because the Lord said, “Well, he is a pretty good man. I guess I will just show myself to him?” No, the Brother of Jared learned a law and obeyed it. . . . I think often the Lord says, “Don’t ask me to do it—you do it.” . . . If you were dependent on the Lord to do all of the work, which is what Satan wanted and still wants, you would be a puppet on a string. But because of the great love of the Lord, he says, “I will give you some of my power until you learn to act independently, just as I do, if you will do my will. And if you will, I will eventually give you all my power.”
                    <br><br>


                    Somehow the Latter-day Saints have the mistaken notion that in the end, when the day comes that the Lord will make them gods or goddesses, when someone lays their hands on their heads and, as it were, says to them, You have now all that you need to be a God—go ahead—this is not true. All that you need to be a God is in you right now. Your job is to take those crude elements within you and refine them. . . . In other words, the Lord is saying, Take the reins. Take charge under the direction of my Spirit. Don’t wait for someone to tell you everything to do. . . . You prevail over people, things, and situations by your faith. </p>

                    True faith combines belief and action in an inseparable partnership that invites God’s power into our lives. Belief, action, power—these are the indispensable elements of faith . . . . On the other hand, false faith is a token confession, a mere mouthing of the words, a superficial belief in Jesus Christ that does not lead to action or discipleship. It may be found in the person who professes a faith in Christ but fails to live His teachings. It is passive in its nature . . . .

                    The Plan of Salvation itself is a system of faith—it begins with faith and continues by faith. To produce salvation, Faith develops from its slender beginnings as belief, progresses through obedience, and becomes an actual power to shape people and events. Faith’s primary role is to produce a person who can be exalted and take his place among the Gods.

                    The purpose of faith is not to change God’s will but to empower us to act on God’s will. Faith is trust—trust that God sees what we cannot and that He knows what we do not. </p>

                    To have Faith in Christ means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him.

                    We cannot develop faith without destroying doubt. Fortunately, the Lord is patient and merciful with us. He knows that the acquisition and strength of our faith is a lifelong process. There may be a mixture of faith and doubts along the way, but with time and effort the doubts can be eliminated and the faith perfected. </p>

                    True faith is not just knowing God can, but knowing why sometimes He doesn’t. True faith is not just believing that things can work out perfectly, but trusting when sometimes they don’t. True faith is not just receiving your answer, but accepting His. </p>

                    Faith is not bravado, not just a wish, not just a hope. True faith is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ---confidence and trust in Jesus Christ that leads a person to follow Him. . . . Faith is more than mental assent, more than an acknowledgement that God lives. Faith is total trust in Him. Faith is believing that although we do not understand all things, He does. Faith is knowing that although our power is limited, His is not. Faith in Jesus Christ consists of complete reliance on Him. </p>

Our conviction of the Savior and His latter-day work becomes the powerful lens through which we judge all else.

                    Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is not something ethereal, floating loosely in the air. Faith does not fall upon us by chance or stay with us by birthright. Faith in Jesus Christ is a gift from heaven that comes as we choose to believe and as we seek it and hold on to it. Your faith is either growing stronger or becoming weaker. . . . The future of your faith is not by chance, but by choice. . . . Faith never demands an answer to every question but seeks the assurance and courage to move forward, sometimes acknowledging, 'I don't know everything, but I do know enough to continue on the path of discipleship.' </p>

                    We hear the words of the Lord most often by a feeling. If we are humble and sensitive, the Lord will prompt us through our feelings. That is why spiritual promptings move us on occasion to great joy, sometimes to tears. . .The Holy Ghost causes our feelings to be more tender. We feel more charitable and compassionate. We are calmer. We have a greater capacity to love. People want to be around us because our very countenances radiate the influence of the Spirit.

                    The Bible tells us that “God is love.” He is the perfect embodiment of love, and we rely heavily on the constancy and universal reach of that love. . . . There are many ways to describe and speak of divine love. One of the terms we hear often today is that God’s love is “unconditional.” While in one sense that is true, the descriptor unconditional appears nowhere in scripture. Rather, His love is described in scripture as “great and wonderful love,” “perfect love,” “redeeming love,” and “everlasting love.” These are better terms because the word unconditional can convey mistaken impressions about divine love, such as, God tolerates and excuses anything we do because His love is unconditional, or God makes no demands upon us because His love is unconditional, or all are saved in the heavenly kingdom of God because His love is unconditional. God’s love is infinite and it will endure forever, but what it means for each of us depends on how we respond to His love. . .


                    <br><br>
                    God will always love us, but He cannot save us in our sins. . . . Repentance, then, is His gift to us, purchased at a very dear price. . . . God’s greater blessings are conditioned on obedience. </p>

                    Any call to serve the Savior in any capacity is an invitation to learn about the principle of one by one, because that was the pattern of His service. His work is focused first, foremost, and always upon serving people---not directing programs. Ministering and blessing are His work---not simply managing His Church as an organization. The scriptures are replete with examples of the Savior ministering to individuals. In fact, most recorded accounts of the Lord's mortal ministry are focused upon His teaching and blessing people one by one. </p>

                    Sadly, in today's world, a person's importance is often judged by the size of the audience before which he or she performs. That is how media and sports programs are rated, how corporate prominence is sometimes determined, and often how governmental rank is obtained. That may be why roles such as father, mother, and missionary seldom receive standing ovations. Fathers, mothers, and missionaries 'play' before very small audiences. Yet, in the eyes of the Lord, there may be only one size of audience that is of lasting importance---and that is just one. </p>

                    The root of both psychological and spiritual sickness is preoccupation with self. Ironically, the believer who is consumed with his own problems—even his own spiritual problems—to the exclusion of concern for other believers, suffers from a destructive self-centeredness that not only is the cause of, but is the supreme barrier to the solution of, his own problems. </p>

                    Humility is the realization of our total dependence on God. . . .The instant we are able to totally acknowledge, accept, and believe that everything we have, are, or ever will be is a gift from God, then humility begins to silently and inconspicuously creep into our hearts. We will never recognize it, because we are too busy being grateful for the fact that we depend totally, solely, and completely on our Father in Heaven and the blessings he pours out upon us.

                    The last thing many believers need today is to go to another Bible study. They already know far more than they are putting into practice. What they need are serving experiences in which they can exercise their spiritual muscles.

                    <br><br>

                    Serving is the opposite of our natural inclination. Most of the time we’re more interested in “serve us” that service. We say, “I’m looking for a church that meets my needs and blesses me,” not “I’m looking for a place to serve and be a blessing.” We expect others to serve us, not vice versa. But as we mature in Christ, the focus of our lives should increasingly shift to living a life of service. The mature follower of Jesus stops asking, “Who’s going to meet my needs?” and starts asking, “Whose needs can I meet?” </p>

                    The only way given in heaven and upon earth whereby a man may be sanctified is in the service of others. Every requirement that God’s plan for our salvation places upon us is based in the giving of ourselves. Having the spirit of selflessness, men and women share themselves, their talents, and their means in benevolent service to mankind and God. Their reward is the freeing of their soul, the growth of their love, nearness to Divinity, and worthiness for the companionship of the Spirit. </p>

                    One can never tell what will be the result of faithful service rendered, nor do we know when it will come back to us or to those with whom we are associated. The reward may not come at the time, but in dividends later. I believe we will never lose anything in life by giving service, by making sacrifices, and doing the right thing. </p>

                    On your journey back to Heavenly Father you will soon realize that this journey isn't just about focusing on your own life. No, this path inevitably leads you to become a blessing in the lives of God's other children---your brothers and sisters. And the interesting thing about the journey is that as you serve God, and as you care for and help your fellowmen, you will see great progress in your own life, in ways you could never imagine.

                    <br><br>

                    Perhaps you don't consider yourself all that useful; perhaps you don't consider yourself a blessing in somebody's life. Often, when we look at ourselves, we see only our limitations and deficiencies. We might think we have to be "more" of something for God to use us---more intelligent, more wealthy, more charismatic, more talented, more spiritual. Blessings will come not so much because of your abilities but because of your choices. And the God of the universe will work within and through you, magnifying your humble efforts for His purposes. . . .


                    <br><br>
                    Those who love and serve God and fellowmen and humbly and actively participate in His work will see wondrous things happen in their lives and in the lives of those they love. . . . No matter your position in your community or in the Church, God will use you, if you are willing. He will magnify your righteous desires and turn the compassionate actions you sow into a bountiful harvest of goodness. </p>

                    The following is a statement by President David O. McKay given in 1965 in President McKay’s Hotel Utah apartment to a group of brethren working in the physical facilities part of the church. While engaged in explaining to them the importance of the work they were engaged in, he paused and told them the following: “Let me assure you brethren, that some day you will have a personal priesthood interview the Savior himself. If you are interested, I will tell you the order in which he will ask you to account for your earthly responsibilities,

                    <br><br>

                    * First, He will request an accountability report about your relationship with your wife. Have you actively been engaged in making her happy and ensuring that her needs have been met as an individual?

                    <br><br>

                    * Second, He will want an accountability report about each of your children individually. He will not attempt to have this for simply a family stewardship, but will request information about your relationship to each and every child.

                    <br><br>

                    * Third, He will want to know what you have personally done with the talents you were given in the pre-existence.
                    <br><br>
                    * Fourth, He will want a summary of your activity in your church assignments. He will not necessarily be interested in what assignments you have had, for in his eyes the home teacher and a mission president are probably equals, but He will request a summary of how you have been of service to your fellow man in your church assignments.
                    <br><br>


                    * Fifth, He will have no interest in how you earned your living, but if you were honest in all your dealings.

                    <br><br>

                    * Sixth, He will ask for an accountability on what you have done to contribute in a positive manner to your community, state, country, and the world. David O. McKay, 1965.

                    In June of 1965, a group of brethren in the Physical Facilities Department of the Church was doing some work outside the Hotel Utah apartment of President David O. McKay. As President McKay stopped to explain to them the importance of the work in which they were engaged, he paused and told them the following.
