                    Sin brings alienation from God. The more we sin, the greater the alienation and the more difficult it becomes to effectively tap the power of God, which alone is sufficient to save us from our sins.

                    The theme of the gospel according to Jesus is that He came to call sinners to repentance. . . . Those who think they are good enough---those who do not understand the seriousness of sin---cannot respond to the gospel. . . . The unmistakable message is that Christ's gracious call to salvation is not extended to those who view themselves as righteous.

                    It is Satan’s plan to win over the hearts and minds of God’s children. In order to accomplish this he must keep us from understanding our Father’s plan. Satan uses deception through partial truth as his greatest weapon. Satan will do whatever is necessary to conceal the true plan of salvation. If he cannot cut it off completely he will cloak it in a mass of philosophical, scientific, or pseudo religious concepts. . .<br><br>
                    Satan does not want men to understand the entire truth, so he confuses them with a portion of the truth. He adds small falsehoods to make it pleasurable. . . . If you give men several loosely based truths, mix in a variety of falsehoods, and then give them authority, they will begin to change the doctrine to fit their needs. . . . Having a small amount of truth is dangerous. It gives a false sense of security and creates apathy. . . . If precious parts of the plan of salvation are missing then the entire plan becomes subject to conjecture, speculation and interpretation. </p>

                    It is better to prepare and prevent than it is to repair and repent. The first line of defense . . . is to prepare ourselves to resist temptation and prevent ourselves from falling into sin. </p>

                    Resistance to sin is better than repentance. Another error into which some transgressors fall, because of the availability of God's forgiveness, is the illusion that they are somehow stronger for having committed sin and then lived through the period of repentance. This simply is not true. That man who resists temptation and lives without sin is far better off than the man who has fallen, no matter how repentant the latter may be. The reformed transgressor, it is true, may be more understanding of one who falls into the same sin, and to that extent perhaps more helpful in the latter's regeneration. But his sin and repentance have certainly not made him stronger than the consistently righteous person. </p>

                    The essence of sin is injury to a relationship. Every act we take as a sin has as its effect to be the breaking or injuring of some relationship: the relationship with God, the relationship with others, and the relationship with ourselves.

                    When we commit sin, we are estranged from God and rendered unfit to enter into his presence. No unclean thing can enter into his presence. We cannot of ourselves, no matter how we may try, rid ourselves of the stain which is upon us as a result of our own transgressions. That stain must be washed away by the blood of the Redeemer, and he has set up the way by which that stain may be removed. That way is the gospel of Jesus Christ. </p>

                    I do not believe that any man lives up to his ideals, but if we are striving, if we are working, if we are trying, to the best of our ability, to improve day to day, then we are in the line of our duty. If we are seeking to remedy our own defects, if we are so living that we can ask God for light, for knowledge, for intelligence, and above all, for His Spirit, that we may overcome our weaknesses, then, I can tell you, we are in the straight and narrow path that leads to life eternal. Then we need have no fear. . . no man is perfect, but one who strives earnestly to conquer weaknesses and grow into perfection does not sin. That is to say, he is not a sinner. A sinner is one who indulges in sin habitually because he take pleasure in it. </p>

                    Thousands of temptations assail, and you make a miss here and a slip there, and say that you have not lived up to all the knowledge you have. True; but often it is a marvel to me that you have lived up to so much as you have, considering the power of the enemy upon the earth. Few that have ever lived fully understood that power. I do not fully comprehend the awful power and influence Satan has upon the earth, but I understand enough to know that it is a marvel that the Latter-Day Saints are as good as they are.

                    Do not suppose that we shall ever in the flesh be free from temptations to sin. Some suppose that they can in the flesh be sanctified body and spirit and become so pure that they will never again feel the effects of the power of the adversary of truth. Were it possible for a person to attain to this degree of perfection in the flesh, he could not die neither remain in a world where sin predominates. . . . I think we should more or less feel the effects of sin so long as we live, and finally have to pass the ordeals of death.

                    A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is ... A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness. They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in. . . We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it: and Christ, because He was the only man who never yielded to temptation, is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation means.

                    From God’s perspective, sin is a vital, necessary component of the learning process of life that He, as master gardener, will prune and forgive. It is not a damnable malice on our part that elicits God’s anger. Sin, along with the pain it entails, is the great educator. Mortality is the school in which we learn to eschew evil and to inculcate the attributes of the Divine.

                    Two principles come into collision in God’s plan for human progression. Moral agency is predicated on a casual connection between choice and consequence. Given the freedom to choose, individuals must be granted the fruits of their choices, good or ill, or such freedom would be only a shadow of genuine agency. And given the uneven playing field called earth, where our untempered spirits contend against bodily weakness, myriad pressures and temptations, and the soul’s own imperfect desires, sin is inevitable—and so therefore are its consequences. The inevitability of sin means the inevitability of acquired sinful human natures, and consequent alienation from God and his heaven. But in his infinite love and compassion, God wills the reintegration of every individual into the heavenly family. The freedom to sin thus collides with God’s desire to save. The problem of how to reconcile this tragic collision is the problem of atonement. . .<br><br>
                    So the alienation in need of repair is not a product of God’s arbitrary decree, of his anger or desire to punish. Neither is it purely a matter of human guilt or shame before the divine presence. It is a product of sinful choices that is incompatible with God’s holiness. “For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory.” Consequences are chosen at the time actions are freely committed. To choose to indulge a desire is to choose its fruit—bitter or sweet.

                    All creation has been organized by God and placed under certain laws and conditions. However, not all kingdoms and laws are the same. That which does not have agency obeys the physical laws imposed upon it, and will receive the glory intended for it, by God. However, that which enjoys the priceless gift of agency must be allowed to find its own level and to live the law of its own choosing. The period between our mortal birth and our resurrection provides the time and means for accomplishing this. . . . It this brief period of probation, God allows that which has agency to sort itself out, to find its own level, and to choose its own law. In the long run, like will find like. The Saints will gather with the Saints, and the wicked will gather with the wicked. . .<br><br>
                    The laws of God will sort us out, or perhaps it would be more correct to say that by the laws of God we will sort ourselves out. The merciful will receive mercy. The loving will be loved. Those who seek for light will find light, and all things will be drawn to their own proper place to be surrounded by beings with the same virtues and the same values.

                    We find ourselves cut off from ourselves. We sin. We act contrary to our image of ourselves and break our deepest integrity. We do not just make mistakes through lack of knowledge or judgment, but consciously go contrary to our sense of right; and therefore we not only suffer the natural consequences of all wrong action (however innocently done) but we also suffer the inner estrangement of guilt – that supreme human suffering. . . We have eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and find the self of action tragically divided against the self of belief. </p>

                    Repentance. The Greek word of which this is the translation denotes a change of mind, ie., a fresh view about God, about oneself, and about the world. Since we are born into conditions of mortality, repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart and will to God, and a renunciation of sin to which we are naturally inclined. Without this there can be no progress in the things of the soul’s salvation, for all accountable persons are stained by sin, and must be cleansed in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. Repentance is not optional for salvation; it is a commandment of God. </p>

                    Change is associated with both repentance and with sin. We can use our agency . . . to choose repentance --- change in our direction toward the characteristics of God by the power of the atonement through which we can overcome all sin and without which we cannot. Here the law of grace and mercy has full sway in our lives. Or we can choose sin --- change in the other direction. Here the law of justice has full sway. </p>

                    The Hebrew word for repentance means to simply turn around or change one’s mind. Repentance is literally a simple turn back toward God. It is as if we are walking a path. We can continue to go on our own way away from God, or we can repent and walk on the path toward Him. This is why God wants to give us time to repent. . .<br><br>
                    The very purpose of life is thus repentance. It is to learn from our experience, and this learning takes place when we repent and do not repeat the same mistakes again. Repentance is the opportunity to make a different choice.<br><br>
                    To allow us to act for ourselves—to be free to follow after our own wills—we had to be outside of God’s immediate presence; otherwise His overwhelming majesty and glory would overwhelm us. Strange as this might undoubtedly sound, God really does not want everyone to be in His kingdom absolutely and unconditionally! Rather, He wants those in His kingdom to be persons who freely choose to be there. . .<br><br>
                    We chose to leave God’s presence so that we could choose to act for ourselves. That is what we wanted. Moreover, it is what God wanted. He loves us so much that He gives us what we truly desire. . . . God will not coerce us to return to Him—the choice to reenter His presence must be ours.<br><br>
                    The doors to our hearts cannot be forced open from the outside—the doors to our hearts lock on the inside, and only we can choose to open those doors because we hold the key. He is willing to accept us back into His presence at any time we are willing to walk back into His arms. </p>

                    Our heart represents our deepest desires. Purifying our hearts is an ongoing process, and it tends to go hand in hand with cleansing our hands. It is possible to have clean hands without having a pure heart, but the process to obtain both clean hands and a pure heart is much the same. Like every blessing, the key is in the Atonement of Jesus Christ. . . .<br><br>
                    Our hands represent our deeds, our actions. If they have been soiled, so to speak, by deeds and actions, it’s time to wash them. Note that we are not required to present hands that have never been soiled; we only need to present hands that are clean. As we’ve all sinned, the real issue is whether we have repented or not. . . . The shame is not so much in needing to repent, but in failing to repent. </p>

                    Because we are mortal we will continuously sin. To avoid the demands of justice we must appeal to the law of mercy. The law of mercy must be initiated by the principle of repentance. This is the true plan of salvation, which enables God to be just and perfect and still make mercy available to his children. This then establishes the greatest priority in our lives; Repentance! It is an integral part of the plan. . . . If our top priority is to repent, what is Satan’s top priority? To keep us from repenting.

It is manifest by those who come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits. It is a burning resolve to make amends with God at any cost. </p>

                    I have encountered many otherwise faithful members who have no hope of inheriting the celestial kingdom and who do not feel loved by the Lord. Usually this has been a result of feeling unworthy because they are not perfect, or at least because they are not nearly perfect. There has, in my opinion, been an ugly epidemic of hopelessness and spiritual despair among some Saints that has robbed them of their rightful “hope in Christ.”<br><br>
                    Unfortunately, aiding and abetting this epidemic of hopelessness have been the efforts of those among us who insist on representing the principle of repentance in its darkest and most somber terms. They portray it as a sort of mini-hell through which errant Saints must pass and in which we must pay for our own sins by our own suffering before we can hope to enjoy the first glimmers of God’s love or approval. This is just the fallacy of being “saved by works alone” in another form.<br><br>
                    Repentance is neither punishment nor is it hell. In fact, the ability and opportunity to repent of our sins and mistakes is in itself a gift of love and grace from our Savior, and is in itself a cause for joy and rejoicing. Our proper response to learning the principle of repentance should be as the response of one dying of pneumonia who discovers modern antibiotics. Surely there is grief involved in repentance (who, after all, can be forgiven but the broken and the contrite?), but repentance is the remedy for and deliverance from our pain rather than the source of it. Repentance is part of the process both in coming to Christ initially and in enduring in Christ once we are converted. Repentance is neither a one-time prerequisite for baptism nor an occasional punishment inflicted upon the wicked and hypocrites among us, but is rather an ongoing part of becoming like Christ and a necessary element in the everyday lives of all true Saints. </p>

                    The invitation to repent is rarely a voice of chastisement but rather a loving appeal to turn around and to 're-turn' toward God. It is the beckoning of a loving Father and His Only Begotten Son to be more than we are, to reach up to a higher way of life, to change . . . . Don't be discouraged. If you are striving and working to repent, you are in the process of repenting. </p>

Even those who are without hope, who live in despair, who have betrayed trust, surrendered their integrity, or turned away from God can be rebuilt. Save those rare sons of perdition, there is no life so shattered that it cannot be restored.<br><br>
                    The joyous news of the gospel is this: because of the eternal plan of happiness provided by our loving Heavenly Father and through the infinite sacrifice of Jesus the Christ, we can not only be redeemed from our fallen state and restored to purity, but we can also transcend mortal imagination and become heirs of eternal life and partakers of God’s indescribable glory.

                    It is a myth that living a life of sin and repenting later somehow makes us better or stronger. The Savior’s greatness and expansive spiritual character was due to his righteousness, not to repentance. The Lord himself declared that blessings are predicated upon obedience. We lose blessings through disobedience and sin and gain blessings through faithfulness and obedience.<br><br>
                    Believing that sinning and eventual repentance yields significant spiritual “experience” or “knowledge” flies in the face of doctrinal reality. Groveling in the gutters of wickedness may make one “streetwise” to the ways of the world, but such “experience” does not compare to the “intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth” which is the “glory of God”.

                    Throughout your life there may be times when you have gone places you never should have gone and done things you never should have done. If you will turn away from sin, you will be able one day to know the peace that comes from following the pathway of complete repentance . . .<br><br>
                    No matter what our transgressions have been, no matter how much our actions may have hurt others, that guilt can all be wiped out. To me, perhaps the most beautiful phrase in all scripture is when the Lord said, ‘Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.’ </p>

                    Some people have innocently, but incorrectly, placed limits on the Savior’s redemptive powers. They have converted His infinite Atonement to a finite one that somehow falls short of their particular sin. But it is an infinite Atonement because it encompasses and circumscribes every sin, every weakness, every addiction, every wrong, and every finite frailty.

                    It helps to remember that repenting of our sins is different from paying for them. To repent means to change, not just to suffer—even though repentance often involves the real suffering of godly sorrow. Jesus has the infinite capacity to restore and repay, and He accepts the full burden of paying justice and restoring our spiritual losses. He will do this if and as we accept the personal responsibility to repent by changing our own attitudes, our habits, our minds, perhaps our friends, and certainly our hearts—to the fullest extent of our ability. As we do so, His grace helps to complete our change of heart.

                    Some wince or turn a deaf ear when they hear the word repentance. To them it is a negative, perhaps even a gut- wrenching concept. Images of pain, sorrow, or even hellfire and damnation fill their minds. But, to the contrary, repentance is a positive principle, filled with hope and glorious possibilities. This is not to suggest there is no pain or sorrow in the process, but rather that such pain and sorrow are of such a constructive nature, such a rehabilitating force, that the repentance process becomes the foundation for new resolves and hope in life . . .<br><br>
                    Repentance is much more than satisfying the laws of justice. It is more than the cessation of wrongdoing, or the expression of sorrow or making confession. None of these alone is true repentance. Repentance does not occur from the outside in, but from the inside out. Repentance is a change of heart and a change of mind manifested by a corresponding change of lifestyle . . . that produces a new person—a changed person. </p>

                    The conditions under which repentance takes place are as generous as Christ can make them, without compromising human agency. The mercy thus freely offered, Christ’s supernal grace, cannot extend to the point of choosing on behalf of individuals. They must choose, and choose again. . . . Christ’s atonement sets up the conditions for humans to demonstrate through ever better and wiser choices, made in accordance with ever nobler and purer desires, that it is their will to live in a way consistent with the eternal principles Christ modeled throughout His exemplary life. . . . Repentance is therefore an ongoing process of repudiating unrighteous choices, acknowledging Christ’s role in suffering the consequences of those sins on our behalf, and choosing afresh to better effect in accordance with purified desire. </p>

                    Repentance is more than a passive process to “get us even”; it is the affirmative process to improve us, refine us, and ultimately perfect us. Its purpose goes far beyond the satisfaction of justice. The law of repentance does much more; it brings about godhood. It opens the door to the cleansing and perfecting powers of the Atonement. </p>

                    The word repentance is often misused and misunderstood. Some, hearing the word repentance, immediately think of sin and hellfire and damnation. To them it is a negative, but to the contrary, repentance is a glorious positive; it is but another name for the process that perfects us. . . . Simply put, repentance is the key that unlocks the powers of the Savior’s Atonement that can both cleanse us and perfect us . . .<br><br>
                    Repentance is not just overcoming our sins; it is also an active pursuit to acquire Godlike traits. It is a humble recognition of the distance between us and God, and a compelling desire to narrow the gap. It is a fresh perspective that we can, with the aid of the Atonement, arise above our mortal weaknesses and limitations and become like God, our Father.

                    You can change anything you want to change, and you can do it very fast. A satanic sucker punch is that it takes years and years and eons of eternity to repent. That's just not true. It takes exactly as long to repent as it takes for you to say, "I'll change"---and mean it. Of course there will be problems to work out and restitutions to make. You may well spend---indeed, you had better spend---the rest of your life proving your repentance by its permanence. </p>

                    The suffering that impels a transgressor toward repentance is his or her own suffering. But the suffering that satisfies the demands of justice for the repentant transgressor is the suffering of our Savior and Redeemer. He suffered for the sins of all, “that they might not suffer if they would repent. . .”<br><br>
                    Does this mean that there is no suffering for the repentant sinner? Because Christ suffered for our sins, some think that all a sinner must do is express sorrow for his sins and accept Christ as his Savior, and all the suffering is the Lord’s. This is not so. . . The repenting sinner must suffer for his sins, but this suffering has a different purpose than punishment or payment. Its purpose is change. The fruits of the transgressor’s personal suffering are the broken heart and contrite spirit described in the scriptures.

                    Those who repent with all their hearts are renewed in their spirits and purified in their perspectives. They gain “the mind of Christ” and come to view things as he does. The Greek word translated as repentance is metanoia, from meta, “after” and noeo, “to understand.” To repent is literally to have an “afterthought,” or to have a “change of mind.” There is a related way to view these matters. Meta also means “above” or “beyond,” as in the word metaphysics. To repent, in this sense, is to gain a perspective or view of things which is beyond the natural or carnal view; it is to see things from a different view, from a higher plane.

                    Repent does not mean that one completely stops sinning. Were such the true definition, no human being would be able to repent, as none of us have the ability to completely stop sinning. Rather to “repent” means to “think differently” about sin. For example, people who sin are unrepentant when they enjoy committing sin and wish down deep that the sinful acts they do were not prohibited by the Lord. Repentant people, on the other hand, are those who still occasionally commit sins, but deeply desire to overcome their fallen and sinful natures. They love the commandments, are desirous to comply with the Lord’s will, and loathe sin in all of its forms. Thus, the difference between repentant and unrepentant is not sinless versus sinful. Rather, it is the difference between the desire to be good and the desire that the commandments be rescinded. </p>

                    Repentance becomes more difficult as sin is more wilful; it is by humility and contrition of the heart that sinners may increase their faith in God and so obtain from Him the gift of repentance. As the time of repentance is procrastinated, the ability to repent grows weaker; neglect of opportunity in holy things develops inability. </p>

                    One of the greatest principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ is the principle of repentance. However, if one has sinned so seriously and becomes habitually a sinner, the spirit of repentance leaves, and he may or may not be able to repent.

                    It is true that the great principle of repentance is always available, but for the wicked and rebellious there are serious reservations to this statement. For instance, sin is intensely habit-forming and sometimes moves men to the tragic point of no return. Without repentance there can be no forgiveness, and without forgiveness all the blessings of eternity hang in jeopardy. As the transgressor moves deeper and deeper in his sin, and the error is entrenched more deeply and the will to change is weakened, it becomes increasingly nearer hopeless and he skids down and down until either he does not want to climb back up or he has lost the power to do so. </p>

We can decide to do better and to be better . . . . Each new day that dawns can be a new day for us to begin to change. We can change our environment. We can change our lives by substituting new habits for old. We can mold our character and future by purer thoughts and nobler actions. </p>

                    Do not try merely to discard a bad habit or a bad thought. Replace it. When you try to eliminate a bad habit, if the spot where it used to be is left open it will sneak back and crawl again into that empty space. It grew there; it will struggle to stay there. When you discard it, fill up the spot where it was. Replace it with something good. Replace it with unselfish thoughts, with unselfish acts. Then, if an evil habit or addiction tries to return, it will have to fight for attention. . . . You are in charge of you. I repeat, it is very, very difficult to eliminate a bad habit [or sin] just by trying to discard it. Replace it.

                    If Christ did not require faith and repentance, then there would be no desire to change. Think of friends and family members who have chosen to live without faith and without repentance. They don’t want to change. They are not trying to abandon sin and become comfortable with God. Rather, they are trying to abandon God and become comfortable with sin. If Jesus did not require covenants and bestow the gifts of the Holy Ghost, then we would have no way to change. We would be left forever with only willpower. We would have no access to God’s power. If Jesus did not require endurance to the end, then we would not internalize those changes over time. They would forever be surface and cosmetic rather than sinking inside us and becoming part of us—part of who we are. Scriptures make it clear that no unclean thing can dwell with God, but no unchanged thing will even want to.

                    Progress means getting nearer to the place you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turn, then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man. </p>

                    It occurred to me recently that life is repentance, that progression and improvement and growth and maturity and refinement are all forms of repentance, and that the God-fearing live in a constant state of repentance. It is not intended that we exist in a constant state of fear or frustration or anxiety, but rather that we have desires for holiness and purity, longings to feel quiet confidence before God. </p>

                    Repentance, therefore, is and will continue to be an ongoing process, not merely a series of events surrounding our sporadic seasons of sinning. Repentance involves a continual process of changing, growing, learning, becoming, and being. Like the Savior, we must receive “grace for grace”—living and learning the gospel “line upon line, precept upon precept.”

                    Although scriptures offer stern warnings for those who procrastinate their repentance, there is a big difference between procrastinating the day of our repentance and working through a repentance process, which more often than not takes more than a day. It is the difference between saying, “I’ll repent one day down the road” and actually spending many days on the road.

                    The miracle of the Atonement is that Christ will forgive our sins (plural). That includes not just multiple sins, but also multiple times we commit the same sin . . .<br><br>
                    Perhaps as we reflect on our lives, it is easy to convince ourselves we have sinned too often and gone too far to deserve the Atonement. We criticize ourselves harshly and beat ourselves up mercilessly. Perhaps we feel we have stepped beyond the reach of the Atonement by knowingly repeating a previously forsaken sin. We understand that God and Jesus were willing to forgive the first time, but we wonder how many more times they will be willing to watch us bumble along before they finally roll their eyes and declare, “Enough already!” We struggle so much to forgive ourselves that we wrongly assume God must be having the same struggle.

                    Constantly believing in, hoping for, and seeking life’s second chances gives us the confidence to live a life that, while not flawless, is determined; not perfect, but steadily progressing. And it’s not just second chances—sometimes third, fourth, fifth, and more chances are needed as we learn and grow along our life’s course. Truly, the only time you run out of chances is when you stop taking them . . .<br><br>
                    The message is the same to everyone: hang on, stay with it, don’t ever give up. Don’t ever lose hope. Every second chance comes with the knowledge that we will never attain perfection in this life. But the earthly effort and struggle is worth it because it gets us that much closer. A second chance is another step in our journey of growth and development. God is more concerned with the final outcome than in our stumbles along the way. </p>

                    One who has walked in the light comes to treasure the light. Should he or she step into the darkness momentarily, they are repulsed by the darkness and yearn to return, as soon as possible, to the light. The new birth results in new behavior. Sin and the child of God are incompatible. They may occasionally meet; they cannot live together in harmony. That is, those who have been born of the Spirit learn to repent quickly, to confess and forsake their misdeeds, to move on. Obviously serious sins require more time, but many of our transgressions may be faced head on and dispensed with in no time at all. </p>

            Forgiveness

                    The miracle of the Atonement is that He will forgive our sins (plural). That includes not just multiple sins, but also multiple times we commit the same sin. . . . Perhaps as we reflect on our lives, it is easy to convince ourselves we have sinned too often and gone too far to deserve the Atonement. We criticize ourselves harshly and beat ourselves up mercilessly. Perhaps we feel we have stepped beyond the reach of the Atonement by knowingly repeating a previously forsaken sin. We understand that God and Jesus were willing to forgive the first time, but we wonder how many more times they will be willing to watch us bumble along before they finally roll their eyes and declare, "Enough already!"<br><br>
                    We struggle so much to forgive ourselves that we wrongly assume God must be having the same struggle. . . . As repentance becomes a regular pattern in our lives, we come to appreciate more and more that offering forgiveness is a regular pattern in His. </p>

                    To feel the forgiveness made possible through Christ's Atonement is indeed a fruit that is precious and sweet, but care must be taken to avoid the temptation to think that we are done with our spiritual walk---that we have arrived. It is one thing to repent of a sin. It is quite another to be fully redeemed from sinfulness. </p>

                    Even though we may believe in the Atonement, the question often arises: “How do I know when I am forgiven of my sins? And if I am forgiven, why do I still feel guilt?” If we feel the Spirit in our lives when we pray or read the scriptures, or teach or testify, or at any other time, then that is our witness that we have been forgiven, or at least that the cleansing process is taking place—for the Spirit cannot dwell in an unholy tabernacle. In most cases the cleansing process takes time because our change in nature takes time, but in the interim, we can proceed with the confidence that God approves of our progress to a sufficient degree that we can enjoy some measure of His Spirit. </p>

                    Save for the exception of the very few who defect to perdition, there is not habit, no addiction, no rebellion, no transgression, no crime exempted from the promise of complete forgiveness. That is the promise of the atonement of Christ. . . . This knowledge should be as comforting to the innocent as it is to the guilty such as parents who suffer unbearably for the mistakes of their wayward children and are losing hope. </p>

                    After a traumatic experience, we, in our confusion, may prolong re-hashing the horror of it, may deepen our anger, even hatred, for those involved, and thereby deepen the damage to ourselves. We need to remember that no matter how justified we may seem to be in our hatred of someone who has harmed us or a loved one, it is the nature of the energy that passes through us that determines the pace of our healing. We were not responsible for the initial assault, but we nevertheless experience the consequences of continuing to process the event in negative ways. We must accept personal responsibility for our healing.<br><br>
                    It seems that our blaming of others causes us more harm than anything they may have initially done to us. What we do to ourselves is more damaging than what another can do to us, in terms of spiritual energies . . . . It is the surging of mercy and compassion through one’s own soul that promotes healing. By eternal law, we draw darkness or light to us through whatever thoughts we entertain . . . . Changing our inner energy is essential.<br><br>
                    It is the Atonement of Jesus Christ that has the greatest power to change a person’s inner environment. This power enables a person, in time, to bring the energy of forgiveness to events and to the participants.<br><br>

                    We must, of course, make judgments every day in the exercise of our moral agency, but we must be careful that our judgments of people are intermediate and not final. . . . We all make judgments in choosing our friends, in choosing how we will spend our time and our money, and, of course, in choosing an eternal companion. . . .<br><br>
                    First of all, a righteous judgment must, by definition, be intermediate. The gospel is a gospel of hope, and none of us is authorized to deny the power of the Atonement to bring about a cleansing of individual sins, forgiveness, and a reformation of life on appropriate conditions.. . .<br><br>
                    Second, a righteous judgment will be guided by the Spirit of the Lord, not by anger, revenge, jealousy, or self-interest.<br><br>
                    Third, to be righteous, an intermediate judgment must be within our stewardship. We should not presume to exercise
                    and act upon judgments that are outside our personal responsibilities. . . .<br><br>
                    A fourth principle of a righteous intermediate judgment of a person is that we should, if possible, refrain from judging until we have adequate knowledge of the facts. . . .<br><br>
                    A fifth principle of a righteous intermediate judgment is that whenever possible we will refrain from judging people and only judge situations. This is essential whenever we attempt to act upon different standards than those of others with whom we must associate—at home, at work, or in the community. We can set and act upon high standards for ourselves or our homes without condemning those who do otherwise.<br><br>
                    A final ingredient or principle of a righteous judgment is that it will apply righteous standards. If we apply unrighteous standards, our judgment will be unrighteous. By falling short of righteous standards, we place ourselves in jeopardy of being judged by incorrect or unrighteous standards our selves. . . . A standard can be unrighteous because it is too harsh—the consequences are too severe for the gravity of the wrong and the needs of the wrongdoer.<br><br>
                    In the intermediate judgments we must make, we should take care to judge righteously. We should seek the guidance of the Spirit in our decisions. We should limit our judgments to our own stewardships. Whenever possible we should refrain from judging people until we have an adequate knowledge of the facts. So far as possible, we should judge circumstances rather than people. In all our judgments we should apply righteous standards. And, in all of this, we must remember the command to forgive.

                    I am convinced that most of us want to forgive, but we find it very hard to do. When we have experienced an injustice, we may be quick to say, “That person did wrong. They deserve punishment. Where is the justice?” We mistakenly think that if we forgive, somehow justice will not be served and punishments will be avoided.<br><br>
                    This simply is not the case. God will mete out a punishment that is fair, for mercy cannot rob justice. God lovingly assures you and me: “leave judgment alone with me, for it is mine and I will repay. But let peace be with you. . .”<br><br>
                    Forgiveness is the very reason God sent His Son, so let us rejoice in His offering to heal us all. The Savior’s Atonement is not just for those who need to repent; it is also for those who need to forgive. If you are having trouble forgiving another person or even yourself, ask God to help you. Forgiveness is a glorious, healing principle. We do not need to be a victim twice. We can forgive. </p>

                    Christ’s judgment is righteous; God’s judgment is righteous. Rarely, if ever, is human judgment of another human being righteous. It is not that we cannot tell good from evil. Often we can. It’s that we cannot distinguish people from the good and the evil they commit. That failure to distinguish, endemic to human judgments, can wreak havoc in the body of Christ.<br><br>
                    What matters is the relationship between context on the one hand and the requirements of law on the other, and we are only ever fully aware of the law. We attempt to see people through the lens of the law rather than seeing into their hearts and life stories, and that is why our attempts at judgment are so deeply flawed. We judge the wrong thing and confuse that thing with what should be the actual object of our attention.<br><br>
                    The judgment of people lies with God alone—righteous human judgment never presumes to judge a person. To put it simply, we are entirely unqualified to judge each other and are not called to do so. We must be extremely careful that we do not confuse our distaste for sin with a right to judge another person. </p>

                    Forgiving makes us free for giving. The opposite is also true. When we fail to forgive we fail to give. It becomes increasingly more difficult for us to reach beyond ourselves because we become more self-centered and more focused on our own hurts rather than on healing the hurts of others. This in turn prevents us from obtaining the joy, blessings, and spiritual growth that come only from service. Thus we find ourselves in a vicious downward cycle which we can only break by freeing ourselves from the ties of bitterness that bind us ever tighter. </p>

                    Inherent in a truly reformed and repentant character is a person's willingness to forgive and love those who have trespassed against him. A natural consequence of our newfound sense of gratitude for the "tender mercies of the Lord" should be a heightened desire to extend that same mercy to others. Too often, however, we compartmentalize our repentance, failing to perceive the relationship between our change of being and behavior and the feelings we may continue to harbor in our hearts and minds toward others who have offended us. We may erroneously view our forgiveness of others as totally independent of or unrelated to the forgiveness we desire from the Lord. In fact the scriptures make it clear that God's willingness to forgive us is tightly intertwined with our willingness to forgive others. . .<br><br>
                    Our refusal to forgive others, as reflected in our actions and the intents of our hearts, may be more offensive than the offenses we have suffered. Could it be that "the greater sin" remains with us because our unforgiving spirit reflects a desire on our part to deny or withhold the spiritual healing effects of the Atonement in the lives of others? Is not our stubborn refusal to extend mercy to others a subtle but real rejection of the Redeemer and his redemptive role in the lives of others as well as in our own lives? Such a rejection, whether blatantly acted upon or hypocritically hidden in our hearts, will naturally result in a poisoning of our souls. Feelings of bitterness, hatred, or revenge will retard repentance, stunt our spiritual growth, and place us outside the reach of the Savior's merciful and forgiving arms. . .<br><br>
                    Each of us is dependent upon the Lord Jesus Christ and his mercy to cleanse us from our sins, to work a "mighty change" in our hearts, and to help us develop a celestial character that we may be worthy to return to God's presence. When we repent we are able to "come boldly unto the throne of grace" and make claim upon the mercy of the Lord. Yet when we harbor hatred in our hearts and fail to extend our mercy and forgiveness, we would refuse others the same access to "the throne of grace." In essence, we say: "Lord, please forgive me of my sins and extend to me thy mercy and compassion, but please don't forgive so-and-so, because he is surely unworthy of thy mercy." Such a selfish and unmerciful attitude is almost Lucifer-like in that we desire to suppress the spiritual development of another and keep him chained in the bonds of sin. . .<br><br>
                    Refusing to forgive those who have offended us is assuming the right of judgeship to which we have no claim. Only Jesus Christ has the right to judge others and dispense the prescription of punishment or the medicine of mercy. Attempting to usurp Christ's right to judge reflects a lack of faith in the justice of God and a reluctance on our part to allow Christ, in his divine role as a perfectly just judge, to "balance the books. . . "<br><br>
                    The truth of the matter is that no attempt on our part, whether through our actions or our feelings, can have any impact on the role of the Atonement in the lives of others. Our failure to forgive will not preclude others from partaking of the fruit of the tree of life---which fruit is the love and mercy of Christ. We can only prevent ourselves from tasting of the tree "whose fruit was desirable to make one happy." While we simmer and stew about the sins and souls of others, the effects of our own sins remain with us---we cannot be sanctified---and our own souls become poisoned with the toxin of bitterness and the venom of vengeance.
