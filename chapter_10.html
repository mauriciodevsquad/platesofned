                    Testimony is a generic term among latter-day saints for the assurance of the reality, truth and goodness of God, of the teachings and atonement of Jesus Christ, and of the divine calling of latter-day prophets. It is the core of LDS religious experience. It is knowledge buttressed by divine personal confirmation by the Holy Ghost. </p>

                    One of the great, unique, and distinctive things about Latter-day Saints is that they have testimonies; they know the work in which they are engaged is true. Other people argue and wrangle about theological matters. They entangle themselves in academic fields and in the fields of reason. . . . But what we have that is singular, that is unique and distinctive, is the personal knowledge, born of the Spirit, resident in the hearts of all of us, that the work is true. We have what is called a testimony of the divinity of the work. </p>

                    One of the profound privileges of membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that none of us have to take anyone else's word for what is true. Personal revelation is a powerful, persuasive antidote to uncertainty and confusion. </p>

                    The Holy Ghost does two things in particular. On the one hand he is a witness to truth, and so he bears testimony of the truth, and that is how we get a testimony, by revelation from the Holy Ghost. But on the other hand the Holy Ghost is a sanctifier, and he has the power to cleanse and perfect the human soul, to wash evil and iniquity out, and to replace it with righteousness. And that is the occasion when we are converted. </p>

                    Three great truths must be included in every valid testimony: 1. That Jesus is the Son of God and the Savior of the world; 2. That Joseph Smith is the prophet of God through whom the gospel was restored in this dispensation; and 3. That the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth.” </p>

                    One of the greatest things about our Heavenly Father’s plan for His children is that each of us can know the truth of that plan for ourselves . . . . We can receive that knowledge directly from our Heavenly Father through the witness of the Holy Ghost. When we know spiritual truths by spiritual means, we can be just as sure of that knowledge as scholars and scientists are of the different kinds of knowledge they have acquired by different methods. </p>

                    We live in a increasingly secular and academic world. For many, the scientific method has become the gold standard for truth. Science is a wonderful thing, but it cannot prove the divinity of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ—only the Holy Ghost can do that . . . . Once you have that witness, then it does not matter what others say, what the theories of the world may be, or what the hypotheses of science may expound, for you know the truth about God with a certainty beyond the confines of mortal measurements. </p>

                    Truth is truth. There is no conflict between science or religion, between philosophy and mathematics. Between theories, yes. Between facts, no! . . . The external world, probed by science, is explicable in terms of formulae and measuring tape. The internal, or what we call the ‘spiritual,’ is not so cut and dried. But it exists. Can I prove it? Can you prove you’ve got a toothache? It’s a surprisingly adept analogy. </p>

                    The world has a long history of rejecting that which it does not understand. And it has particular trouble understanding things it cannot see. But just because we cannot see something with our physical eyes does not mean it doesn’t exist. Indeed, there are more things in heaven and earth . . . than are dreamt of in our textbooks, scientific journals, and worldly philosophies. The universe is filled with wonders profound and astonishing—things that can be comprehended only through spiritual eyes.
                    <br><br>


                    When we choose to believe, exercise faith unto repentance, and follow our Savior, Jesus Christ, we open our spiritual eyes to splendors we can scarcely imagine. Thus our belief and faith grow stronger, and we will see even more.

                    We become so accustomed to learning through our physical senses–by sight and sound and smell, by taste and touch–that some of us seem to learn in no other way.


                    <br><br>
                    But there are spiritual things that are not registered that way at all. Some things we simply feel, not as we feel something we touch, but as we feel something we feel. There are things, spiritual things, that are registered in our minds and recorded in our memories as pure knowledge. . . . As surely as we know about material things, we can come to know of spiritual things.</p>

                    Religion is not a matter of the intellect. . .



                    Religion is a matter of getting the Holy Ghost into the life of an individual. We study, of course, and we need to evaluate. And by virtue of our study we come up with some foundations that get us into the frame of mind so that we can seek the things of the Spirit. But in the end the result is getting our souls touched by the Spirit of God. . .



                    Religion is a thing of the Spirit. </p>

                    There is also what we might call internal evidence, the quiet but pervasive assurance that comes to the human heart, by and through the Holy Spirit. It is an evidence less visible but more certain, an evidence that establishes spiritual realities.

                    A confirming spiritual witness in our hearts concerning the truth of what we have come to know in our minds is obtained through the process of revelation. The Holy Ghost certifies more completely and helps us to feel deeply the truth of what we have come to know intellectually. Knowledge certified as true by the Holy Ghost yields understanding and produces an illumination, a comprehension, a perspective, and a depth of desire and commitment not obtainable through reason alone.

                    The spirit of God speaking to the spirit of man has power to import truth with greater effect and understanding than the truth can be imparted by personal contact even with heavenly beings. Through the Holy Ghost the truth is woven into the very fiber and sinews of the body so that it cannot be forgotten. When spirit touches spirit it leaves an indelible impression that is more convincing than the beholding of an angel or can come through the traditional senses. </p>

                    In this world of illusion, many essential Truths are not apparent, but Man has within him a divine instinct to exercise Faith, and he will do so, with or without true information. In order, then, to keep him from placing his Faith in powerless things, the Lord prepares the way for Man to have true Faith by revealing to him, directly by the Spirit or through messengers or scripture, the Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel . . .


                    <br><br>
                    Immediately the message of Truth creates a crisis for a person and puts him on trial, because in his soul is the power to recognize saving Truth. As the Lord reaches after him, he cannot avoid choosing. . .
                    <br><br>


                    If man accepts the Truth and cultivates it, the Holy Spirit begins to gather spiritual energy in him, accompanied by an expanding inner vision of things as they really are. This divine activity in his soul continues growing with the person’s acceptance and obedience. Faith, then, at its primary level, is a believing response to the Spirit which initiates a dynamic and reciprocal relationship with the Lord.
                    <br><br>


                    Unbelief, on the other hand, is resistance to the Truth sown in the heart by the Spirit. The vision closes down, and the person is left in his Natural condition. He may find, in fact, that he is in worse condition spiritually than he was before the message of Truth came to him. . . . One’s relationship with the Lord is never the same after he has in some way been penetrated by the Spirit of Truth. He has to choose. </p>

                    Before you joined the Church you stood on neutral ground. When the gospel was preached good and evil were set before you. You could choose either or neither. There were two opposite masters inviting you to serve them. When you joined this Church you enlisted to serve God. When you did that you left the neutral ground, and you never can get back on to it. Should you forsake the Master you enlisted to serve, it will be by the instigation of the evil one, and you will follow his dictation and be his servant. </p>

                    We are engaged in the work of the Lord. This is his church. It administers his gospel and teaches his doctrine. It bears his priesthood and performs his ordinances. These are facts. They are true. A knowledge of such things, an inner certitude, we call a testimony. We cannot long progress in the kingdom without a witness of this work, without a testimony. It is a testimony of the Savior, of his gospel, and of the Restoration, which must be at the foundation of all we do. In fact, a knowledge of such things motivates us and impels us to faithfulness in the face of opposition; such an assurance helps us know why we do what we do. </p>

                    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a place for people with all kinds of testimonies. There are some members of the Church whose testimony is sure and burns brightly within them. Others are still striving to know for themselves. The Church is a home for all to come together, regardless of the depth or the height of our testimony. I know of no sign on the doors of our meetinghouses that says, “Your testimony must be this tall to enter.”

                    Testimony is as elusive as a moonbeam; it’s as fragile as an orchid; you have to recapture it every morning of your life. You have to hold on by study, and by faith, and by prayer. If you allow yourself to be angry, if you allow yourself to get into the wrong kind of company, you listen to the wrong kind of stories, you are studying the wrong kind of subjects, you are engaging in sinful practices, there is nothing that will be more deadening as to take away the Spirit of the Lord from you. It will be as though you had walked from a lighted room into darkness. </p>

                    Oh, if I could teach you this one principle! A testimony is to be found in the bearing of it. Somewhere in your quest for spiritual knowledge, there is that leap of faith, as the philosophers call it. It is the moment when you have done to the edge of the light and step into the darkness to discover that the way is lighted ahead for just a footstep or two. The spirit of man, as the scripture says, indeed is the candle of the Lord. It is one thing to receive a witness from what you have read or what another has said; and that is a necessary beginning. It is quite another to have the Spirit confirm to you in your bosom that what you have testified is true. Can you not see that it will be supplied as you share it? As you give that which you have, there is a replacement, with increase! </p>

                    First, we must desire to find God above all other desires. If we want a real testimony, if we want to seek God until we find him, even if we want eternal life—all these things can be ours, if we desire them, so long as we do not desire other things more. We show what we really want by what we do, not just by what we say. . .

                    <br><br>

                    Next, we must live worthy of having the Lord’s spirit near to us. . . . To be strong, a testimony must also be built on spiritual feelings and insights. . .


                    <br><br>
                    A third element in the development of testimony is simply experience. Our understanding of truth needs an incubation period, a chance to settle in and take root in preparation for the fruit that can eventually be borne. . . . Our learning from experience over time yields knowledge having a special kind of depth, for the maturing of our spiritual understanding reflects itself in the maturing of our own character. </p>

                    Sometimes, the sheer desire to believe is stronger than having a knowledge of things. Many people have acted contrary to the knowledge that they have received and fallen off the path, but rarely do you see someone who is striving to believe fall off the path. There is something powerful behind the concept of hope that drives actionable faith. </p>

                    No one in this mortal sphere will ever be taught any principle of truth that was not first known to him or her in the premortal estate. Individuals are not converted, for example, in the sense that they surrender old views for new and better ones. What happens is that the missionaries declare the truths of salvation to people who innately respond by saying, “Yes, that is right! It is what I have always believed.” They do so because its truths have been planted in their hearts and, upon hearing them again, it is like recognizing an old friend. The conversion process would be better described as “a coming home,” “an awakening,” or “a distant memory.” The gospel brings with it a familiar spirit attended with warm feelings, which take us back to a time long before our births when we were first taught its principles and vowed to live by them. </p>

                    As we introduce a truth into our minds and work to personally learn whether or not it might be true, something happens beyond the veil where all truth originates. The Lord “feels after” us in response to our efforts to “feel after” Him (D&amp;C 112:13). Figuratively, the Holy Ghost facilitates a form of “sympathetic vibration” which occurs between the truth within our minds and the truth outside the veil. These “sympathetic vibrations” cause the truth to expand within us. Apostle John Taylor explained it this way: When truth shall touch the cords of your heart they will vibrate; then intelligence shall illuminate your mind, and shed [its] luster in your soul, and you shall begin to understand the things you once knew, but which had gone from you. </p>

                    As we are inside the cloud of fire, the physical sensations will continue, but the feelings will be more moderate than the initial surge. Possibly the word reverberation best describes the effect that exists as the Spirit lingers. Some people call it a tingling sensation. However, it is not a cold chill or a goose bump experience; that would imply a surface skin response. Since the Spirit is literally within us, the feelings are physical, yet internal. It is an internal reverberation caused by the presence of the Spirit.

                    However, even those residual reverberations do continue to subside. It’s almost as if our physical bodies become accustomed to the presence of the Spirit. We know that the Spirit hasn’t departed (or, in our analogy, we know that we are still standing in the middle of the flaming cloud) but the intensity lowers sufficiently that our clues become more subtle. Residual feelings would persist--- still physical, but less remarkable.
                    <br><br>


                    The spirit can remain with us and express itself in that lower intensity for extended periods of time. For example, think back on a general conference session–and even after the meeting—when the Spirit blessed us for hours.

                    <br><br>

                    However, as we experience the arrival of the Spirit, our attention is actually only briefly upon the physical sensations. Almost immediately, if not instantly, the Spirit brings to us feelings of joy and peace. Those soul-satisfying feelings quickly capture our attention, and we no longer wish to pay attention to physical clues. Instead, our focus is on the immense satisfaction the feelings are providing. </p>

                    I invite you to consider two experiences most of us have had with light.

                    <br><br>

                    The first experience occurred as we entered a dark room and turned on a light switch. Remember how in an instant a bright flood of illumination filled the room and caused the darkness to disappear. What previously had been unseen and uncertain became clear and recognizable. This experience was characterized by immediate and intense recognition of light.

                    <br><br>

                    The second experience took place as we watched night turn into morning. Do you recall the slow and almost imperceptible increase in light on the horizon? In contrast to turning on a light in a dark room, the light from the rising sun did not immediately burst forth. Rather, gradually and steadily the intensity of the light increased, and the darkness of night was replaced by the radiance of morning. Eventually, the sun did dawn over the skyline. But the visual evidence of the sun’s impending arrival was apparent hours before the sun actually appeared over the horizon. This experience was characterized by subtle and gradual discernment of light.

                    <br><br>

                    From these two ordinary experiences with light, we can learn much about the spirit of revelation.

                    Conversion denotes changing one’s views, in a conscious acceptance of the will of God. If followed by continued faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism in water for the remission of sins, and the reception of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, conversion will become complete, and will change a natural man into a sanctified, born again, purified person—a new creature in Christ Jesus. Complete conversion comes after many trials and much testing. To labor for the conversion of one’s self and others is a noble task. </p>

                    Although the word conversion can be synonymous with the act of accepting Christ or the event of baptism, true conversion is much more than that. it is a Christ-centered change of heart, desires, attitude, behavior, and character. Conversion isn't a one-time experience or something that happens overnight, but is the cumulative effect of our continual coming unto Christ and being perfected by him. </p>

                    We qualify for eternal life through a process of conversion. This word of many meanings signifies not just a convincing but a profound change of nature. . . . The gospel challenges us to be “converted,” which requires us to do and to become. </p>

                    Conversion is sometimes difficult to define because it is so multifaceted. It is not necessarily synonymous with membership in the Church or activity in the Church. The journey of conversion continues long after baptism and goes deeper than attending meetings. True conversion depends on obtaining an accurate view of life, the plan of salvation, God’s love, and Christ’s Atonement. </p>

And what he ought to see, hear, and understand is truth---eternal truth---and then practice it. That is conversion. . . . When we understand more than we know with our minds, when we understand with our hearts, then we know that the Spirit of the Lord is working upon us. </p>

                    Learning and receiving revelation must necessarily include both the heart and the mind, or thoughts and feelings, intellect alone cannot produce a testimony. You cannot think your way to conversion, because you cannon convince your mind of something your heart does not feel. . . . Intellect is important. The ability and willingness to ponder, think, and reason through issues is crucial. But intellect alone will not lead to conversion, because true conversion happens in the heart. </p>

It comes when we are obedient to the commandments of God. Conversion comes when we serve those around us. It comes from earnest prayer, regular temple attendance, and faithful fulfillment of our God-given responsibilities. It takes consistency and daily effort. </p>

                    Testimony is a beginning; it is not a conclusion—and conversion is ongoing and should be ever deepening. Testimony comes as we study a gospel truth; we ponder, we pray, and by the witness of the Holy Ghost we receive confirmation that that truth comes from God. That’s the beginning of a testimony. Thus, a testimony is what we know to be true by the witness of the Holy Ghost.
                    <br><br>


                    Conversion grows out of testimony and extends from testimony. Conversion is consistently being true to what we know. . .In the world in which we live, testimony will not be enough. Now, I don’t want that to sound surprising or shocking, but there are many people, both now and in the history of the church, that have had seemingly strong testimonies, but they have withered in opposition, and they have fallen away. Testimony alone is not enough. Testimony must give rise to and lead to deepening, continuing, ongoing conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ.

                    <br><br>

                    Converted unto the Lord, not converted to the missionaries who taught them; not converted “because I’m a sixth generation member of the church, and it’s my heritage and the traditions of my fathers”; not converted to the wonderful programs that we have in the church. First, foremost, converted unto the Lord. . . Let me repeat. Testimony is essential; it is the beginning; it is what we know to be true by the witness of the Holy Ghost. A testimony—what we know to be true by the witness of the Holy Ghost—must become reflected in the consistency of how we live what we know is true. That is ongoing, deepening conversion unto the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

                    Conversion is an enlarging, a deepening, and a broadening of the undergirding base of testimony. It is the result of revelation from God, accompanied by individual repentance, obedience, and diligence. Any honest seeker of truth can become converted by experiencing the mighty change of heart and being spiritually born of God. . .

                    <br><br>

                    Conversion is an ongoing process and not a onetime event that results from a powerful or dramatic experience. Line upon line and precept upon precept, gradually and almost imperceptibly, our motives, our thoughts, our words, and our deeds become aligned with the will of God. Conversion unto the Lord requires persistence and patience. . .

                    <br><br>

                    Testimony is the beginning of and a prerequisite to continuing conversion. Testimony is a point of departure; it is not an ultimate destination. Strong testimony is the foundation upon which conversion is established.

                    <br><br>

                    Testimony alone is not and will not be enough to protect us in the latter-day storm of darkness and evil in which we are living. Testimony is important and necessary but not sufficient to provide the spiritual strength and protection we need. Some members of the Church with testimonies have wavered and fallen away. Their spiritual knowledge and commitment did not measure up to the challenges they faced. . .

                    <br><br>

                    A testimony is spiritual knowledge of truth obtained by the power of the Holy Ghost. Continuing conversion is constant devotion to the revealed truth we have received. Knowing that the gospel is true is the essence of a testimony. Consistently being true to the gospel is the essence of conversion. We should know the gospel is true and be true to the gospel. </p>

                    Many individuals question the strength of their personal testimony and underestimate their spiritual capacity because they do not receive frequent, miraculous, or strong impressions. Perhaps as we consider the experiences of Joseph in the Sacred Grove, of Saul on the road to Damascus, and of Alma the Younger, we come to believe something is wrong with or lacking in us if we fall short in our lives of these well-known and spiritually striking examples.

                    We must be careful, as we seek to become more and more godlike, that we do not become discouraged and lose hope. Becoming Christlike is a lifetime pursuit and very often involves growth and change that is slow, almost imperceptible. Regarding the sudden spiritual transformations of such notables as Alma the Younger, Paul, Enos and King Lamoni, “We must be cautious as we discuss these remarkable examples. Though they are real and powerful, they are the exception more than the rule. For every Paul, for every Enos, and for every King Lamoni, there are hundreds and thousands of people who find the process of repentance much more subtle, much more imperceptible. Day by day they move closer to the Lord, little realizing they are building a godlike life. </p>
